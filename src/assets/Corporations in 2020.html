<h2>CORPORATIONS IN THE WORLD OF CYBERPUNK 2020</h2>
	</div>
	<br>
	<div class="c">
	<p>Here is a list of the corporations referred to in Cyberpunk 2020 reference books. The list focuses on American corporations. This is due to the fact that most of the scenarios for Cyberpunk 2020 are supposed to take place in the United States. There are of course other important corporations that you may need to include in your scenarios.</p>
	<p>However, certain considerations have led me to set out certain rules regarding foreign corporations in the United States, which could explain their secondary role in the tribulations related to the adventures of your characters :</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Major corporations of communist or neocommunist states such as Russia or China are emanations of central power. There is therefore a tendency to confuse their interests and means with those of the governments of these countries. These corporations are also limited in their actions by the laxity and heaviness of the administration of the communist countries, the lack of productivity or by the control of their profits by the local triads or mafias.</li>
	<li>European corporations, while they may become major financial empires, do not have the freedom of action of American trusts or Japanese zaibatsus. Indeed, traditionally, state interference in the economy, strict worker protection laws, the enforcement of international competition law, embargoes, laws on the possession and use of weapons reduce the room for manoeuvre of these companies, which must limit suspicious operations within their borders.</li>
	<li>African, Asian, South American or Indian countries, even if they are industrialized, are not often the cradle of a corporation, but rather serve as a place of production or experimentation for Japanese, European or American groups. Indeed, there is no shortage of space, labour is cheap and justice is not very attentive.</li>
	<li>Countries such as Australia, Canada, Brazil or Mexico are countries where business creation initiatives have been weak, but where global corporations have maintained or developed a high degree of presence.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><b>Notes :</b></p>
	<ul>
	<li>A corporation's home country generally contains its headquarter, but not necessarily most of its production or distribution units. Thus, a company can be firmly established and active anywhere in the world even if its headquarter is located in a country of minor importance.</li>
	<li>This list includes mega-corporations with a personal army, agencies around the world and political support (e.g. Petrochem) as well as local companies, without militiamen, with only a limited number of employees, but enjoying a wide popularity due to the diffusion or quality of its production (e.g. Glock).</li>
	</ul>

CHOOHZTM (not its actual chemical formula) is a complex grain alcohol produced by genetically engineered yeasts and wheat strains created by Biotechnica. The potential of CHOOHZTM was realized almost immediately after it was introduced, and within a few years all fuel burning vehicles and power plants had converted to the new fuel. Although Biotechnica held worldwide patents, it lacked the production facilities to meet worldwide demand, forcing it to license production to several large agribusinesses and petro-corporations. These deals made Biotechnica an extremely wealthy, but still not particularly large, company. It is currently expanding and working on its next big biotechnical breakthrough.</td></tr>

The world is getting smaller all the time, people regularly work in many countries these days and this is making salary paytments very tricky, an employee paid in US dollars may find things a little too expensive while working in Tokyo for example. As time goes on corporations, and even governments, will find that the only way to convince their employees they have a stable salary is to pay them in euro. Within the next twenty to thirty years national currencies should just fade out from use and be replaced by the euro, which will probably be renamed the worlddollar, terrabuck, or something equally neutral sometime soon.<br>The Eurobank reserves are stored in the mountains between Freilassing and Salzburg in the strongest vaults on the planet. The entrance is precisely on the old border between Germany and Austria. The reserves hold not only the traditional rare metals and metals, but also valuable patents, property deeds, and other items. It is also rumoured that the vaults contain blackmail information that the secretariat keeps on various groups and individuals.<br>For investors the bank offers Eurobonds. These are sold for values in multiples of a thousand eurodollars at fixed interest rates usually one percent over the current bank interest rate) with repayment at the end of a specified term, usually multiples of five years.</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="7"><p>After its technological coup in 1998 with the Hermes II spaceplane, the European Space Agency looked fit to control most of the rapidly expanding sphere of colonized space. In the same year ESA began the recruitment of milions of people from the central African nations. In an event now known as the ESA Hireout, entire African townships were brought into orbit, trained and put to work. ESA took control of LEO for manufacturing and colonization, developing the more advanced Aries series space planes and constructing hundreds of workshacks and the magnificent Crystal Palace habitat (a glittering toroidal playground for the rich).</p><p>Since its founding, ESA has focused on orbital manufacturing and has obtained funding from several Euromultinationals who have traded both raw material and eurobucks for a slice of the orbital manufacturing industry. ESA also implemented a historic deal with the Soviets, who provided heavy lift capacity in return for spaceplane payloads. Orbital Air (the main carrier of personnel into space) was instgated by ESA and is stil the only licensed owner of the Aries series spaceplanes.</p><p>By 2015, ESA was the largest, richest and most capable spacefaring organization in existence. It creamied a 10% commission off all space-related manufacturing, and controlled most of the law enforcement in LEO and out to Luna through the EEC-controlled Interpol space police. They proceeded, to build several major orbital habitats, including three O'Neill colonies (huge rotating cylinders of lunar rock and metal framing several kilometers in diameter).</p><p>Unfortunately, as ESA grew and expanded, it became more bureaucratic and authoritarian. The main orbital population (approximately 68%) stemmed from the Hireout and was growing exponentially. These individuals, many born and bred in space, were hardy and individualistic and saw the orbital colonies as "home". This population, known as the "hightiders", eventually revolted against the growing pressure from ESA to overcrowd the orbital colonies and force many workers to operate in sub-standard conditions for litle reward. This blewup into a series of short but violent clashes between Hightiders and ESA known as the <i>O'Neill Wars</i>, during which ESA lost control of both O'Neill One and the newer Galileo Cylinder.</p><p>By 2025 ESA still controls the majority of facilites in LEO. It maintains both Crystal Palace and Paradise Station (an O'Neill cylinder at the L-4 point). ESA also has access to long range drive technology and with Soviet help has set up a Mars Base at Isic Planitia. All ESA facilities are now kept under oppressive surveillance by Interpol and elite ESA corporate squads to ensure that the O'Neill Wars do not have any successors.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="7">Fujiwara is one of the bigwigs in the financial world. This is a main bank, one of the characteristics of a Japanese corporate group. The dividends on Japanese stocks are low, so ordinary investors don't get them as property, except for some minor speculation: therefore, corporations do not get much working funds from stock sales, so they depend on bank loans for capital.<br>The bank controls other corporations through the use of loaned cash. it can then exert pressure on the company's board of directors to follow policies beneficial to the main bank, or can even take over through threat of foreclosure. Fujiwara has set up a keiretsu system, and controls corporations that aren't under the Fujiwara name via cash control. They use this power to build up the Fujiwara group, and you can tell a subordinate company by the superior attitude of visiting Fujiwara staff.</td></tr>

Soon, Kiroshi practically monopolized the optics business due to the quality of its orbital eyes and other products such as the opti-shield, the optical HUD (heads up display), the optical remote cyber-cam, and the anti-dazzle protection "Opti-Flash".<br>Kiroshi has very close ties with Kenjiri, and they have a joint design firm in orbit, to be closer to the manufacturing process.<br>Now, Kiroshi is aiming to dominate the Asian market. Hong Kong and Shanghai, where cheap Kiroshi imitations are made, are the company's prime targets.</td></tr>

They are to the 2000's what Cray was to the 1980's and '90's, but on a larger scale. Microtech is the industry standard. Defense agencies around the world rely on Microtech mainframes and the Euro-Space Agency has several. With its hold on the specialized mainframe industry, Microtech is worried not so much about acquiring proprietary data through espionage as protecting itself against such theft. This is where most of its covert and military resources go, as well as a sizable amount of its own computerpower. Microtech must be vigilant for external threat as well, however, as there are several larger corporations who would like to acquire Microtech, or see it eliminated in order to further the success of their own products.

They began as a group of at-sea oil drilling companies that were bought out by billionaire Damon Russell with the intent that at-sea colonization would start with the ownership of the ocean's vast energy resources.<br>As early as 1993 Russell began aquaculture and mariculture on an immense scale and introduced processed krill to the diet of millions worldwide. His attempts at genetically engineering sea plant and animal life resulted in the creation of new foods and other organic products for consumption. Their greatest creation is the floating synthetic plastic known as Crypropalan. Made from the remains of genetically engineered microfauna, it is what many of the floating cities rest on. Strong, incredibly bouyant, light and derived from a renewable natural source, it was a breakthrough in construction science.</p><p>In 1996 Russell's scientists perfected their tidal energy converters and thermal varience converters and began beaming energy to the power-hungry masses in major cities of the world. Damon Russell was killed in an extraction attempt in 2006 by OTEC's largest rival, Unified Ocean Sciences, a hostile takeover attempt by Sean Lowell, head of UOS. Amanda Russell, Damon's wife has run the company since his death and has expanded OTEC's earnings by thirty percent in seven years.</p><p>Since then OTEC has been the undisputed leader in ocean technological advances and continues to rule the seas. They have been under media assault in recent years because of the fact that they have attempted to nationalize their floating islands and stations. This would give them more claim to the surrounding resources than they already have.<br>The corporation has, however, been a large source of food, plastics, petroleum products, liquid hydrogen production, stress science technology (which gets used in space exploration as well as underwater colonization), genetic engineering, and motion energy sciences. Space exploration and colonization is their next field of endeavor and they are currently seeking an energy source with greater energy return per pound than fusion.</p></td></tr>

Currently, their eye is on China, which is improving its commercial lift capability rapidly. Also, Euro-flight Corporation is expanding its operations and expecting to bring orbital services on line soon. This has OA worried about its monopoly.

<tr><td colspan="7">Peak &amp; Derrera is one of those rare corporate oddities in the business world of 2020 : they were small enough to duck the fallout from the crash of '94, but strong enough to keep their heads above water. In 1970, George Peak and Salvatore Derrera were a couple of grunts stuck in the middle of the Cambodia invasion. During quiet periods, the pair would talk about what they would do if they made it back to the world. There was nothing else to do but talk, and it was better than listening to the crickets chirp. Both men had heard the news : the situation at home was starting to sour. They shared the same philosophy that the smart investor would tum to technology as America's industrial base weakened.<br>Peak and Derrera both survived the war and kept in contact with each other when they returned to the US. In early 1972, "Sally" Derrera called Peak with a business offer : if both men could scrape up $25,000 to start with, it was possible for them to break into the precious industrial diamond market. Peak was skeptical but after some research decided to invest. Thus in January 1973 an idea that began as a way to soothe the combat jitters flourished into a financial reality. The partnership of Peak &amp; Derrera was born.<br>The company expanded into Asia at first, treading delicately into the new Chinese and Japanese markets that were opening up. When the computer age began in 1979, the company cornered a nice chunk of the silicon market. With customers like Atari and IBM, the firm's fortune was assured. Peak &amp; Derrera was incorporated in 1980.<br> With the boom of the 1980s, the company grew quickly, breaking into various industrial and precious metal markets. When the party ended in '94, most of the Asian developments were sold off for vital cash. Later, that cash was used to invest in the critical European market.<br>In 2002, George Peak sold his interests in the company and became an independent investor. The Wasting Plague incapacitated Sal Derrera in 2003, and he sold his share to Penstone Equities. Orvis became chairman of the board, but the firm's original name was retained for its prestige.</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="7">Petrochem Industries keeps the world running, literally. They are the world's largest producer of CHOOH2 and control millions of acres of arable land across the United States. This land is used to grow the genetically altered wheat that is used to make CHOOH2 (surplus grain is shipped across the world as food). Petrochem is also one of the largest remaining oil producers. With the oil supply dwindling, all remaining fossil fuels are used to make plastics and other synthetics. Petrochem has more fertile oilfields than any other company. All of these assets are huge and accordingly hard to protect from other companies that would like to usurp Petrochem's wealth. As a result, Petrochem invests huge amounts of money in protecting itself, maintaining an armed force worthy of a small country. Currently, all of the major petrochemical corporations are in a research race to come up with a viable artificial plastic base to entirely replace petroleum products. Consequently, industrial espionage is rife in the industry.</td></tr>

It was during this time that many of the 20th century's corporate superpowers fell; GE, Beatrice and Columbia Entertainment were just a few of the casualties. However, amid the attendant chaos of the Wasting Plague, the Food Crash, the 2nd Central American Conflict and the First and Second Corporate Wars, a brilliant scientist by the name of Dr. Corvus Crowe rose to fame and fortune. Having completed his doctorate at nineteen, he spent his early twenties working under Janice Grubb as a software engineer for Kenjiri Technologies when they were developing the first Net interface algorithms. He left the project before it was finished (for unknown reasons) and went on to become one of the founders of BioDyne Systems, the corporation credited with creating the first viable cyberlimbs. As one of the few members of the "BioDyne Seven" who had a head for business, Dr. Crowe bought out several fragmented post-Collapse corporate holdings. In 2009, while BioDyne Systems was going bankrupt, Raven Microcybernetics was declared an official corporate entity. Later that year, BioDyne became another property of the investment group formed by Dr. Crowe, whose new corporation embarked on a meteoric rise to American industry's top twenty.</td></tr>

In a brilliant move, the SRC refitted nearly 40% of its MIRV missile fleet to heavy payload carriers, leasing them to ESA and other nations. With the best heavy lifting vehicles and the largest body of data on long-term, man-in-space projects, the Soviets were able to trade themselves into the current space frontier boom. They sold advertising on spacesuits, set up construction projects, and eventually established Kosmosov, the heavy lifting vehicle combine.</p><p>Trading for ESA technical information, the SRC also built up a moderate military presence with orbital stations, spy and laser sats, battle sats and ground laser arrays. The huge laser complex at Sary Shagan has since been entirely converted to laser-lift vehicle support, but can be reconverted within 72 hours.</p><p>Still working closely with ESA, the Soviets maintain a strong and active presence in space. They are clear leaders in terms of raw lift power out of the Earth well and have been enormously successful in construction of long-term life-support systems. The Soviets are also the recognized experts in space psychology. There is a minimal Soviet presence within the Chryse base on Mars; however, rumours abound that the Soviets are planning their own unmanned missions to Mercury and Venus to set up mining facilities.</p></td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="7">Formed by three friends on the bones of a Japanese airgun company, Tsunami was born in the Net, and this has flavored its feel to this day : Tsunami is a very eclectic, loosely organized corporation. Tsunami utilizes the latest in computer-assisted design and manufacturing equipment, and has maintained a reputation of being more than a little ahead of the cutting edge of technology, a rep that has many mystified, as they would appear to lack the resources and manpower to rival giants like Militech in terms of research and development. Rumors abound of a rogue AI (stolen from either the Pentagon or Arasaka), but Tsunami flatly denies such claims and there has been absolutely no proof brought to light on this topic. For many years, Tsunami was a top secret organization, working strictly behind the scenes, providing designs to governments and a few select corporations, but in the last three years they have expanded their services into the public market. Response has been excellent, and Tsunami's economic growth has been almost frightening.</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan="7">Tsunami has well kept medical facilities in each of their offices. They maintain a fleet of eighteen AV craft (mostly AV-4s, but at least 2 AV-6s and an AV-8 are kept for testing purposes), six helicopters, and six corporate jets. Although their security and covert operatives are extremely well armed with conventional and heavy weapons (much of it not available on the market...), they have immediate access to little in the way of military grade vehicles or artillery (although they own at least six PA suits, all custom). They can, of course, call on the impressive assets of Militech and Lazarus when necessary.<br>Tsunami maintains at least three top secret testing and construction facilities, one somewhere in Japan, one in the Rockies, and a third in an as yet unknown location (most rumors point to a crater outside Tycho base, but as Tsunami is not known to possess any space transports, this is hardly credible). Tsunami is rumored to have a powerful "rogue" AI, possibly named Muramasa, at their command, as well as several lesser computer systems, all very well defended.</td></tr>

Few competitors can match WNS' information gathering capabilities, and WNS ensures that it remains at the forefront, not only through legitimate means, but also through spying, espionage, sabotage and illegal snooping of all sorts. WNS does not run any stations of its own, choosing instead to broker its information to the highest bidder.
