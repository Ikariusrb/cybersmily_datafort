                  First I have created both a subreddit and a discord to help
                  support my site's feedback and communication. Stop by either,
                  I will be posting updates in both. The links are on the top
                  right.
                </p>
                <p>Next we have enhancements:</p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp;* new Club Generator for Cyberpunk Red and 2020. Thanks
                  to MurdocAddams from Reddit on provide some tables to base the
                  utility on. Now randomly generate a bunch of bars, clubs,
                  lounges, what have you for your game.

                  &nbsp;* Corporation Master Data List. This list I plan on
                  having both Cyberpunk 2020 and Cyberpunk Red corporations. It
                  is a work in progress. If you see one that is missing please
                  email me or contact me through Reddit or Discord. I just ask
                  that you have the reference of what book mentioned it and the
                  page.
                </p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp;* Character Generator for Cyberpunk 2020 Ammo Section
                  now has Casing and Type. So you can now get a brass cased AP
                  rounds.
                </p>
                <p>

                  In the process of working on a Character Generator for
