              <h5>2022-02</h5>
              <p><strong>02-05</strong> - Took some time off (finally bought Witcher 3 with both expansions :P). Didn't
                get too much done with the site. But I do have a few things.</p>
              <p>First up 3 requested items:</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Added SP/SDP tracker on the ACPA forms. Now you can use to help with combat if needed.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* In the Cyberpunk 2020 character sheet you now have a setting to disable the Armor Layering
                function, in case my math is bad. Which it can be.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Added a field on the Cyberpunk 2020 sheet to show the BOD Damage Modifier (BDM).</p>
              <p>Here are some small changes I added:</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Added a checkbox to suppress stat and save penalties from wound level. I know there is some
                cyberware and drugs that are capable of doing, so, there.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Fixed a bug in the Combat Tracker for random armor generation.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Added more functionality in Combat Tracker opponent armor section.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Updated some layout issues and styling issue as part of an code framework I use
                (Angular/Bootstrap/etc.).</p>
              <p>If you see any bugs or other issues please let me know. Either email me using the button above, or ping

              <h5>2021-11</h5>
              <p><strong>11-21</strong> - Been a few weeks. Been hammering away at some goodness for the the site.</p>
              <p>This release you now have a new app to start create ACPAs for your Cyberpunk games. Keep in mind it
                isn't perfect. There are a few rules not implement and descriptions and some text from the book wasn't
                included. Though the page number to find the details is listed. Trying to stay within the RTG homebrew
                rules.</p>
              <p>Another thing added was that you can now click on a location in the Armor table both in the Character
                Generator and the Combat Tracker for Cyberpunk 2020 and instead of doing armor damage, you can do damage
                to the character. This will take the damage done, the type of damage/ammo type it is, and the SP damage.
                Then it will calculate and apply the wounds to the character.</p>
              <p><strong>11-01</strong> - The year is almost over. I was able to get a lot done. Not as much as last
                year, but how much more can I add ;-).</p>
              <p>This month we have a few things. I rewrote most of the armor/fashion stuff to have it integrated with
                the Character Generator for Cyberpunk 2020. That was massive to get it all done. But you will benefit.
              </p>
              <p>Other thing done was adding Cyberdeck and Programs to the generator as well. Now your Netrunner can
                start going hog wild with it.</p>
              <p>The only other thing from my list of enhancements from a poll I did is the Character generator for
                Cyberpunk Red. Again, not sure if I will be doing that as another team is working with R Talsorian on
                one already.</p>
              <p>That doesn't mean I have more things. A request for ACPA generator for the rules in Maximum Metal was
                requested and I start looking into that.</p>
              <p>IF you have another ideas for enhancements, bugs you've come across, or just want to shoot the shit. I
                love the feedback from the community. I'm on most of the cyberpunk discord servers as well as email me
                using the link on the nav bar above.</p>
              <p>Also check me and Wisdom 000 (from Datafortress2020.com) over on <a
                  href='https://www.twitch.tv/cyberpunkuncensored'>Cyberpunk Uncensored twitch</a> every 1st and 3rd
                Wednesday of the month. We talk Cyberpunk and other ramblings from old men. Please check us out.</p>
              <p>Till next time.</p>
              <p>CYBER :D</p>
              <h5>2021-10</h5>
              <p><strong>10-24</strong> - A few updates to various sections.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* CP2020 Deck Manager - Fixed a bunch of bugs with this, mainly the issues around MU for
                published decks not reflected correctly.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* CP2020 Char generator - magazine capacity can now be manually set if you want to make it unique
                (Thanks to Mikhail over on discord).</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* CP2020 Char generator - Ammo items can now be deleted in the ammo section. Thought I had one
                there, but apparently not. (Again, one from Mikhail).</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* CP2020 Char generator - Life Events can now have more data. Keep in mind too much data might
                have issues for the sticky data, but if you save the sheet to file, this shouldn't be a problemt (thank
                Mikhail for that).</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* CP2020 Char generator - Life Style housing bugs fixed. Should allow utility toggling and pay
                properly.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* CP2020 Char generator - Life Style housing added a choice to own property instead of renting,
                just in case you character is luckly enough to own. (another one of Mikhail's)</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* CPRed Weather generator - fixed a bug with cold snap/heat weave durinig winter. Winters won't
                have 100+ degree days.</p>
              <p><strong>10-11</strong> - Been on a bit of a hiatus. Real life pulled me in a few directions and took me
                longer to implement some of the changes with this release. Enjoy!</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* CP2020 Char generator - Implemented IU Roles and Skills. There are still some automation
                needed, but it is a start. Blame Wisdom 000 for that.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* CP2020 Char generator - Implemented Vehicle section. Now you can keep track of a character's
                vehicles.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* CP2020 Char generator - Implemented magazine manager for weapons.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* CPRED Night Markets - Export Night Market results to PDF is available.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* NEW! - Weather Generator for Cyberpunk Red.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Bug fixes where I found them.</p>
              <p>Till next time.</p>
              <p>CYBER :D</p>

              <h5>2021-08</h5>
              <p><strong>08-31</strong> - Tackled some of my backlog with this release.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* CP2020 Char generator - Implemented weapon options to help with modifying your weapon.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* CP2020 Char generator - Implemented ammo section to keep track of what's available.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* CP2020 Char generator - Implemented magazine manager for weapons.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* CP2020 Combat Track - Fixed a bug where the target movement modifier was dupicating (Thanks to
                Audrey for that).</p>
              <p><strong>08-01</strong> - This month starts off with the following:</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Fixed a bug with the skills not aligning right in the CP2020 character generator.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Fixed verb tense in Headline generator and added some more terms.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* the Core Lifepath generator for Cyberpunk Red is now available. Yes, it does role lifepaths and
                prints to PDF.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Gig WNS News gets update a few times in a month. These are news happening with my ongoing
                campaign set during the 4th Corporate war. Check them out.</p>
              <p>Till next time.</p>
              <p>CYBER :D</p>
              <h5>2021-07</h5>
              <p><strong>07-27</strong> - </p>
              <p>Enhanced the Character Generator for Cyberpunk2020 skills section.
                Added quite a bit. First off you can add new skills to any of the attribute sections, just click on the
                + at the bottome of the section.
                Next you can click on the skill name and it will open a skill dialogue.
                In that window you'll be able to update the skill, set modifiers for the skill, delete skills, and it
                shows you how many IP are required for the next level.
                Did I also mention that Special Ability section has been improved as well?
                You can now add more special abilities, if you multi-role or gain some Family in your lifepath.
                Also I removed the hardcoding of the list creation and using the json file from the data section.
                Does this mean anything to you? If you have a blank sheet and don't see all the special abilities and
                available language options, click the reset button.
                This doesn't impact existing characters I'm afraid.
              </p>
              <p>Fixed a bug with the armor calculations as well on the character generator.
                You all need to call me out when I do something silly like that :P.
                Another bug for armor was allowing more than 3 layers to be activated or adding more than 1 hard layer.
                Finally, "what's this below the SP row?" you say? Well it is a place to capture SDP values now.
                It will track when the location becomes impaired/disabled and when it is destroyed with color and
                labels.
              </p>
              <p>Next I continued to work on the Deck Manager with a lookup of programs from Bartmoss' Brainware
                Blowout.
                Note that the MU and Costs vary a tad from the RAW for building programs. But don't think too much into
                it.
              </p>
              <p>Did some tweaks to the Lifepath generator for Cyberpunk Red, specifically added the core book charts.
              </p>
              <p>I know right about now you are asking yourself. "This is waaaaayyyy too much for my brain to digest!".
                Well buckle up buckaroos got some love for my boy Wisdom 000 with the Interlock Unlimited Combat Action
                system in the weapon section.
                Yup, I did some IU stuff to the character generator as well.
                Plan to include a couple more things as well for all you IU players. </p>
              <p>Cyber keeps on rolling.</p>
              <p>CYBER :D</p>

              <p><strong>07-15</strong> - Add a few random dice rolling within some of the CP2020 apps. Add a random
                generator for the Fixer Calculator to help out filling out quickly or give some ideas on what to add to
                them. Great for NPC fixers. Fashion calculator got some Randomized love as well. Now you can random roll
                a piece of clothing.</p>
              <p>Another app updated was the Deck Manager for Cyberpunk 2020. It now has a lookup for published
                cyberdecks from Bartmoss Brainware Blowout.</p>
              <p>The above were on whim to implement. There is a list that is out there that I still need to work on.
              </p>
              <p>
              <ul>
                <li>Weapon Builder for CP2020</li>
                <li>Vehicle section on Character generator for CP2020</li>
                <li>Integrate the fashion calculator with the Character Generator for CP2020</li>
                <li>Character Generator for CP Red</li>
                <li>Cyberdeck Manager inserted into the Character generator</li>
                <li>Finally, create and extending a LifePath generator for CP Red</li>
              </ul>
              </p>
              <p>Quite a few things in the list. I have started on the weapon builder, just thinking through the design
                of it and how it will interaction with the character sheet. Things like how the modifiers should be
                applied etc. I will pick it up soon</p>
              <p>Oh, and I'm currently working with Octarine5orcerer with his Foundry module for Cyberpunk 2020. Haven't
                contributed much. Go check it out <a href='https://github.com/OctarineSourcerer/cyberpunk2020'>HERE</a>
              </p>
              <p><strong>07-08</strong> - This installment I did some bug fixes. The main thing is I have added 2 new
                generators to the site for CyberPunk Red, Bodegas Generator and Vendit Generator.
                I add them to the same page that has the Night Market. Go check them out. Also, as usual, I have added
                some new WNS news items as my Cyberpunk 2020 campaign contines.
              </p>
              <p>Till next time.</p>

              <h5>2021-06</h5>
              <p><strong>06-05</strong> - Another release. I know... so soon. This wasn't too much of a biggie. It's a
                Night Market generator for Cyberpunk Red.
                Nothing too complex but something I know people are looking for. This was the second item in that Poll I
                did.
              </p>
              <p>In other news me and Wisdom 000 from <a href="https://datafortress2020.com">Datafortress 2020</a> are
                continuing our broadcast over on
                <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/cyberpunkuncensored">Cyberpunk Uncensored Twitch</a> channel every other
                Tuesday. We've complete our assessment of
                Cyberpunk 2077 and a 2 part review of Cyberpunk Red. Come check us out we air 7PM EDT/6PM CDT/4PM PDT.
                Also I'm in a game with Reservoir Panda
                again being hosted on CP Uncensored Twitch Sundays. Though Technical issues have been causing a slow
                start to that campaign.

              <h5>2021-05</h5>
              <p><strong>05-30</strong> - Major update to the Character Generator for CyberPunk 2020, LifeStyle sectoin.
                This section will allow you to track the character's money, expenses, and identities. This also has a
                calculator for spending on entertainment and one off services. I want to thank all of the people over on
                the Datafortress 2020 Facebook group for voting on it and thanks to Wisdom 000 for hosting the poll.
                That
                poll I did also gave me clarity on some other new apps/features to add to the site. I will be doing
                other
                polls in the coming months as well. My next app to tackle will be a Night Market generator, which was in
                second place.
              </p>
              <p>Also this release I fixed some bugs in a few areas of the site. One major area was the pdf generation
                of
                Character Generator for Cyberpunk 2020. That had a few issues and I cleared up most of them. If you see
                any bugs, please let me know by clicking on the email icon in the upper right corner.
              </p>
              <p>Lastly, thank you everyone who continues to use this site. I have seen may comments in various social
                outlets
                letting me know that my work is appreciated. This site is a work of passion for me and glad to know that
                others
                enjoy it. Thank you.

              <p><strong>05-09</strong> - Fix some major bugs this week with the Red Net Arch generator and the CP2020
                character generator.</p>
              <p>Speaking of Characer Generator for Cyberpunk 2020, I am/will be doing a major overhaul of it. Posted a
                poll to hear what people would like to see next on the site. I have prioritize what features and apps
                will be happeing to the site in the coming months.
                One at the top of the list is to add some new sections into the CP2020 Character Generator. Fo that I
                needed to do a pit of redesign. Here's what was done so far:
              </p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Remove the area where an image would be place. Reason I never implemented was I didn't have a
                place to store images for you and I won't allow an external link onto the site (for reasons).</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Moved the armor/wound sections to where the image use to be.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Moved Rep out of the skill section and to be under Roles and implemented a dice roller for it.
              </p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Moved Humanity out of the skill sectoin and now resides with the other derived stats.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Skill Section reworked.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* &nbsp;* Move general IP to section header</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* &nbsp;* Removed Rep and Humanity per above</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* &nbsp;* Layout of skills is now based on STAT sections and follows a top-down right-left
                sorting for each section.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* &nbsp;* Increased the font size of skills</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* &nbsp;* Removed the Cyberware to its own section.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Reoganized the LifePath, Gear and Weapon Section to be their own sections.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Weapon section added Range and Cost columns when viewed on full screen of a desktop/laptop</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Cyberware section other than being moved, nothing much has changed.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Gear section had a bit of work don</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* &nbsp;* Moved to its own section</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* &nbsp;* Layout is mutliple columns on large screens</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* &nbsp;* Add DELETE button to remove a row if needed</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* &nbsp;* Add ADD button to add more rows if needed</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* LifePath got a bit of love</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* &nbsp;* Moved to its own section</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* &nbsp;* Change layout so events are in another column on large screens</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* &nbsp;* Change layout move the dice, source selection, always an event option, and input years
                to section header</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* &nbsp;* Add section for Siblings to have some more info about each of them, like are they
                older/younger, like/hate you, their names, etc.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* &nbsp;* Add an ADD button to the siblings to add more</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* &nbsp;* Add a DELETE button to the siblings for in case you added one by mistake</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* &nbsp;* Add an ADD button to Life Events section to add more events as needed.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* &nbsp;* Add a DELET button the life events to remove ones you don't need. Note: this won't
                relabel a year. Need to do that manually for now.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* </p>
              <p><strong>05-05</strong> - Small update to the Quick Netrunner Rules I have.</p>
              <p>After some playtesting recently with the rules (which I wrote 20+years ago), I needed to update them a
                bit. Significant changes is the calculation of the Program Modifier, which I reworked to allow a super
                runner to crack into the most secured DataFort. I also update some of the tables as some of the results
                didn't make sense.</p>
              <p><strong>05-01</strong> - A more bug fixes and small tweaks:</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Fixed an issues on NET Architect for Cyberpunk Red.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Small tweaks to NET Architect to allow you to choose programs to add</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* &nbsp;* cosmetic tweaks to the Drug Lab Calc.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* &nbsp;* cosmetic tweaks to the Combat Zone Generator.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* &nbsp;* cosmetic tweaks to the Fashion Generator.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* &nbsp;* cosmetic tweaks to headline generator</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* &nbsp;* cosmetic tweaks to Fixer Calc</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* &nbsp;* cosmetic tweaks to deck manager</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* &nbsp;* cosmetic tweaks to CP Red Jumpstart Kit generator</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* &nbsp;* cosmetic tweaks to CPJK Lifepath generator</p>
              <p>Trying to make the site have more consistency with the various apps and icons.</p>
              <p>Till next time.</p>

              <h5>2021-04</h5>
              <P><strong>04-25</strong> - A new app and more bug fixes:</p>
              <P>&nbsp;* Fixed some issues on CP2020 character generator for skills.</p>
              <P>&nbsp;* News Headline Generator app for both CP2020 and CP Red (look under Apps)</p>
              <P>&nbsp;* Updated CP 2020 Lifepath Generator with dice icons instead of text buttons</p>
              <P>&nbsp;* Integrated Interlock Unlimited stuff into CP2020 Lifepath sources/options (<a
                  href='https://datafortress2020.com' target='_blank'>Datafortress 2020 IU</a>):</p>

              <P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Extended clothes, hairstyles, and affectation charts </p>

              <p><strong>04-17</strong> - Wow April has been productive for ths site. Donen some clean up on the
                site. Here's the list:</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* behind the scenes code refactoring to make my life easier.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* updating the CP 2020 Character Generator with more instructions on how to use.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* updating the CP 2020 Character Generator armor section with an icon button instead of text
                button.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* CP 2020 Character Generator and Combat tracker had some rework on the weapon list. Now there
                are some settings for random rolls. You can chose the type, subtype, availability and exclusion of
                names.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* CP 2020 Combat tracker bug fixes (initiative on individual opponents not working, as well as
                some other minor ones.)</p>
              <p>So what's ahead? Looking to get the cyberware list into the combat tracker, add a randomizer for armor
                on both the character generator and combtat tracker, looking to enhance the Red NET architect tool a bit
                more, and a few other things (like standardize the menu icons for all apps).</p>
              <p>Lastly, I am thinking of creating some tutorial videos for the site in case the interface isn't as
                intuitive as I think it is. Would love to hear from all of you if this is a good idea or not.</p>
              <p><strong>04-10</strong> - Major update to the NET Arch generator for Cyberpunk Red. Here's the list:</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Export to PNG format now.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Add/Delete floors and branches. NOTE: Adding a new floor will always be a file, but you can
                change it after it is created. Also when adding floors manually there is no constraint to have multiple
                bottom levels. That is something that you need to manually keep track of.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Color configuration for the icons, borders, text, and can be done on individual floors.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Has the constraints for creating an arch (reroll programs/passwords, max controllers allowed,
                can't branch on first 2 floors, minimum of 3 floors...).</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Specifies the program names now (doesn't have their all their detes, you need to look in the
                core book for them.).</p>
              <p>&nbsp;* Calculates the total cost (cost per floor and each floor value set).</p>
              <p>There is still a bunch of manually work to do done when you create your own, but this tool should help
                you</p>
              <p>There is a infrequent bug with rendering, but it isn't too bad all things considerd.</p>
              <p>I still have qutie a bit left to do (adding demons...). Still don't have a PDF button, but you can use
                Chrome/Edge to do a print as PDF. The page should be formatted to remove the non-related elements on the
                page.</p>
              <p><strong>04-01</strong> - Updated parts of the site that didn't adhere to the <a
                  href='https://rtalsoriangames.com/homebrew-content-policy/'>R Talsorian Hombrew Policy</a>.</p>
              <p>Combat Tracker - remove the stats pulled from the source books for the templates. Added generic gangers
                and security guards. More will be added in the future.</p>
              <p>Combat Zone Generator - summarized the entries a bit more and corrected some mispellings.</p>
              <p>In other News, Wisdom of <a href='https://datafortress2020.com'>Datafortress 2020</a> and I are doing a
