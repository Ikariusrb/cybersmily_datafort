            This site was created back in the late 90's as an unofficial fan
            site dedicated to the R. Talsorian's tabletop RPG Cyberpunk 2020 and
            Cyberpunk Red. Here you will find articles, web page apps, and other
            unofficial resources for CyberPunk 2020 and Cyberpunk Red.

                  <strong>07-??</strong> - The updates keep coming. This month
                  we have bug fixes and some new stuff
                </p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp;* Master Vehicle List is now live. This contains all the
                  RTG vehicles that are cannon with Cyberpunk 2020. Some of the
                  attributes are blank as per the source. I am still debating on
                  whether to keep them that way or update them to be more inline
                  with Max Metal stats. Thanks to Ikarius over on
                  <a href="https://discord.gg/Jhy9Txx5hP">Discord</a> for
                  helping with this.
                </p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp;* Character Generator Roles sections has been reworked,
                  specifically on the skills. I remove the hard limit of
                  selectable skills, change it to free for text box but will a
                  hint displaying the skill that should be there as well as a
                  type ahead search for adding skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp;* Speaking of skills, the list has been update to be
                  more inline with some other sources and removed redundancies.
                  Thanks to Tekquest for assisting in the clean up.
                </p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp;* Character Generator for Cyberpunk 2020 also has
                  improved the notes section. There were issues with performance
                  when typing in that section, hopefully you will see some
                  improvements there.
                </p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp;* Updated some of the Max Metal metadata in the Max
                  Metal Calculator. Added Cyberwalk type and updated some of the
                  source pages on equipment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  &nbsp;* Fixed a bug in the ACPA Generator for the PDF where
                  internal slots were duplicated to the external ones.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp;* Added a few new Peeps that were NPCs in my game.</p>
                <p>
                  I am still working on the Character Generator for Cyberpunk
                  Red. I am making progress, slow, but some. It will be coming
                  and just takes time to get things the way I want them. I am
                  enjoying all the feedback I am getting on the Cybersmily's
                  Datafort Discord. There has been some great things coming from
                  the community. It is helping me and this site a lot to hear it
                  all. If you are interested, please click the Discord icon in
                  the menu bar.
