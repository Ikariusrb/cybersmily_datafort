            This system reflects a better way to calculate starting funds for a character.
            Itâ€™sbased on a character's skills and <span class="game-skill">Special Ability</span>.
            The first thing you look at are the character's career skills.
            Below are the criteria to create a Money Modifier (MM).
        </div>
        <ul style="list-style-type:none">
            <li>For every career skill and <span class="game-skill">Special Ability</span> above level 4, add 2 points to MM. </li>
            <li>For every pick-up skill above a 4, add 1 point to MM. </li>
            <li>Add the character's <span class="game-stat">LUCK</span>, Age, and 1D10 then add to MM. </li>
        </ul>
        <div>
            Take the total MM and multiple it by the career's starting money shown in the Career Chart below.
            The result is how much eb a charcter starts with.
            This system is a bit generous as players should be spending some of this cash on living space and possibly a vehicle.
        </div><div>
            If a <span class="game-term">Referee</span> doesn't want the players to start up with this amount, they can play around with the numbers as they see fit.
            But with me, everything I give to players, I will take it away eventually ;)

    Example: Killer is a Solo.
    His <span class="game-skill">Combat Sense</span> is a 6 (2 MM total) and 5 of his other career skills are above 4 (10(5*2)points + 2 MM = 12 MM total).
    He has 3 pick-up skills above 4 (3(3*1)points + 12 MM = 15 MM total).
    His <span class="game-stat">LUCK</span> is 6 (6 points  + 15 MM = 21 MM), he's 23 years old (23 points + 21 MM = 44 MM total), and he rolled a 2 on 1D10 (2 points + 44 MM = 46 MM total).
    Being a Solo, Killer starts off with 650eb times 46 MM which gives him a grand toal of 18,800eb to start.
    Now compare that to the possible 24,000 he would have got if he had a 10 <span class="game-skill">Combat Sense</span> or the low being 4,000.
