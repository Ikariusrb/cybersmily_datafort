          I was refing a game in which a character had a <span class="game-stat">LUCK</span> stat of 8.
          This means he has above average luck compare to the rest of the population, right?
          Well, he had a few problems.
          First time he fired his weapon he shot one of his friends (almost killed him).
          Second time he fired only to injure himself with his own weapon.
          The last time he fired his weapon it jammed on him.
          The problem was the player had a <span class="game-stat">LUCK</span> of 1, meaning he rolled 1's.
        </div>
        <br>
        <div>
            That got me thinking about what the <span class="game-stat">LUCK</span> stat should do.
            Most of my players never put a lot of points into <span class="game-stat">LUCK</span> because it wasn't used that often.
            Maybe once in a while for a critical roll, but often it wasn't used during whole gaming sessions.
            Now I have a few changes that I'm using with my group right now.
            You spend <span class="game-stat">LUCK</span> points to help with fumbles and die rolls.
        </div>
        <div>
          The table shows the <span class="game-stat">LUCK</span> point cost and what benefit the player receives for burning those points.

      <div>
        1pt - Avoid a fumble roll.
        The attempt still fails, but there's no critical failure.
        PC uses this cost after rolling an unmodified 1.
      </div>
      <br/>
      <div>
        3pt - Reroll a 1.
        PC uses this cost after rolling an unmodified 1.
      </div>
      <br/>
      <div>
        4pt - The PC gets an additional d10 to roll.
        Add the 2d10 together and apply it to the skill/stat.
        There is no critical success or failure on either d10.
        Player must announce they're using these points before they roll the die.
      </div>
      <br/>
      <div>
        5pt - The PC is consider to have rolled a critical success and rolls another d10 adding it to 10 + skill/stat.
        This is as if the PC rolled a nat 10 on the die.
        Player must announce they're using these points before they roll the die.</div>

      <div class="csd-desc-sect csd-rounded">
            They also are allowed to use the same point for point basis too.
            This gives a person better luck than a 10% of failure every time they roll the die.

  My players really like this.
  It made them want to have <span class="game-stat">LUCK</span> and helped avoid a lot of really bad dice rolling.
