  A player starts with 90 CBPs (Character Building Points) when making a new character.
  The player uses these points to gain stats, skills, and cash. The cost of stats, skills, or cash in CBPs are as follows:
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="small-2 medium-1 medium-offset-1 columns"><h4>CBP</h4></div>
    <div class="small-8 end columns"><h4>Benefit</h4></div>

<div class="row">
    <div class="small-2 medium-1 medium-offset-1 columns">1</div>
    <div class="small-8 end columns"><small>1 STAT pt.</small></div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="small-2 medium-1 medium-offset-1 columns">1</div>
    <div class="small-8 end columns"><small>4 career skill pts</small></div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="small-2 medium-1 medium-offset-1 columns">1</div>
    <div class="small-8 end columns"><small>2 Pick-up skill pts</small></div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="small-2 medium-1 medium-offset-1 columns">1</div>
    <div class="small-8 end columns"><small>5,000 eb</small></div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="small-10 medium-9 medium-offset-1 end columns">
        <div class="btn-ttl-desc-col csd-rounded">
          NOTE: <span class="game-skill">Special Ability</span> has a new cost.

  So, let's say John is making Razor the Solo.
  Out of the 90 points and puts 62 towards stats, giving him an <span class="game-stat">INT</span> 6, <span class="game-stat">REF</span> 10, <span class="game-stat">TECH</span> 4, <span class="game-stat">COOL</span> 7, <span class="game-stat">ATTR</span> 6, <span class="game-stat">LUCK</span> 5, <span class="game-stat">MA</span> 7, <span class="game-stat">BOD</span> 10, <span class="game-stat">EMP</span> 7.
</div>
<div>
  John spends 11 CBPs on careers, for a total of 44 skill points that he can allot to only Solo career skills.
  After allotting points Razor's skills are:</div>
<div>
  <span class="game-skill">Combat Sense</span> 7(5+4)*,
  <span class="game-skill">Awareness/Notice</span> 7,
  <span class="game-skill">Handgun</span> 6,
  <span class="game-skill">Martial Arts (Karate)</span> 4,
  <span class="game-skill">Melee</span> 1,
  <span class="game-skill">Weapons Tech</span> 2,
  <span class="game-skill">Rifle</span> 3,
  <span class="game-skill">Athletics</span> 3,
  <span class="game-skill">Submachine gun</span> 4,
  <span class="game-skill">Stealth</span> 5</div>
<div>
  This leaves him with 17 CBPs for pick-up skills and cash.
  He spends 10 CBPs for pick-up skills, with 20 skill points to spend on any skill.
</div>
<div>
  <span class="game-skill">Intimidate</span> 3,
  <span class="game-skill">Streetwise</span> 4,
  <span class="game-skill">Shadow/Track</span> 4,
  <span class="game-skill">Driving</span> 3,
  <span class="game-skill">First Aid</span> 2,
  <span class="game-skill">Pick Lock</span> 4
</div>
<div>
  With the remaining 7 CBPs for cash, this gives him 35,000 euro to spend.
  You might think it's a lot, but he has to pay for all surgery costs for his cyberware, individually.
  He cannot use the rules from <span class="game-source">Chromebook 2</span> (pg 101) and lump all the surgeries into a CR.
</div>
<div>
  Also housing prices have been altered.
  Instead of paying a flatsrate for a room, you pay for the cubic meter.
  I know players like to take some liberties with one room stuff.
  For 18 cu. m. it costs 200 eb for Apt./Condo. and 150 eb for a room in a house.
  This is rental price, not for ownership.
  The dimension are: 3m x 3m x 2m room.
  Not very big is it?
  Also, the modifiers for Zones should be a random value as follows:</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="small-3 medium-2 large-1 medium-offset-1 columns"><h4>ZONE</h4></div>
    <div class="small-8 end columns"><h4>MODIFER</h4></div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="small-3 medium-2 large-1 medium-offset-1 columns"><small>Combat</small></div>
    <div class="small-8 end columns"><small>1d10/3 - 1</small></div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="small-3 medium-2 large-1 medium-offset-1 columns"><small>Moderate</small></div>
    <div class="small-8 end columns"><small>1d10/2</small></div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="small-3 medium-2 large-1 medium-offset-1 columns"><small>Corporate</small></div>
    <div class="small-8 end columns"><small>1d10</small></div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="small-3 medium-2 large-1 medium-offset-1 columns"><small>Executive</small></div>
    <div class="small-8 end columns"><small>1d10 +10</small></div>
</div>
<div class="row">
    <div class="small-10 medium-offset-1 end columns">
        <div class="btn-ttl-desc-col csd-rounded">
            NOTE: Combat zone - Yes you can find an abandoned apartment.
            There is no security though, so expect to have break-ins every day.
            If you're paying rent then the chance isn't that high.
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<div>
  The benefits are higher security in the higher zone levels.
  Don't think you'll get many break-ins at the Executive Zone, but in the Combat Zone except once a week or day with the occasional cyber psycho looking for a kill.

  You may wish to use the <a href="/mods/money" fulltitle="Alternative Money System" desc="Starting money system for new characters.">Alternative Money</a> system I wrote.
  If so, simply knock of 10-20 points from the starting CBPs.
