<div>
  When you roll initiative, you divide that by 10, rounding up (ie. You roll a 17 and you get 2, you roll a 22 and you
  get 3).
  This is how many action you get in a turn, minimum of 2.
  A borg with a <span class="game-stat">REF</span> 15 and a <span class="game-skill">Combat Sense</span> of 10 starts
  off with 3 actions minium.
  You may only perform 1 type of action in a given round (example, you've got 3 actions, so you can dodge, move and fire
  a weapon in the round.)
  When you take multiple actions there is still the -3 for the second, -6 for the third, -9 for the fourth, etc.
  The types of action are divided into sections, MOVE and SKILL.
  MOVE means you aren't really concentrating on how it's done.
  SKILL is when you are taking great care into what you are doing (like firing a weapon to hit a person).
  Here are types of actions that you may take in a round:</div>
