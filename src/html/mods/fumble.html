      This fumble chart uses the <span class="game-stat">LUCK</span> stat.
      When the player rolls an unmodified 1 they then roll a d10 and add their current <span
        class="game-stat">LUCK</span> stat to the roll.
      If the player used any points prior to rolling an unmodified 1, deduct them from <span
        class="game-stat">LUCK</span> stat before you roll on this chart.
      Otherwise use the player's current <span class="game-stat">LUCK</span> stat.

    <div>
      The player may add their <span class="game-stat">LUCK</span> to this roll.
      If you're using my <a href="/mods/luck">point system</a>, they may use their <span class="game-stat">LUCK</span>
      in that way to the roll.

        <h5>Catastrophic!</h5>The worst thing that could have happen did. This will always lead to a Death Save or
        mortal damage. What happens may not have anything to do with what is involved (i.e. the player is <span
          class="game-skill">shadowing</span>, and fumbles. A car he didn't see hits him square on). The Referee needs a
        good imagination on what happens.
