    <div class="">I feel that the <span class="game-term">Special Abilities</span> in Cyberpunk are useful but limited and not very well defined. In the main book I feel that the only well defined abilitiy is <span class="game-skill">Combat Sense</span>. It gives a very specific use and bonus. R Talsorian has made a few attempts at rectifying this. <span class="game-source">Wildisde</span> made <span class="game-skill">Streetdeal</span> a better and extremely useful skill. I think that all the <span class="game-term">Special Abilities</span> can be improved with an overhaul similiar to what was done with <span class="game-skill">Streetdeal</span>. I know the new third edition is going to get rid of all careers and <span class="game-term">special abilities</span>. I think they should be kept. How many corporate executives are netrunning hackers? How many mafia dons are medtechs? I believe that a mafia don could have some medical background but would be more specialized in <span class="game-skill">Streetdeal</span>-ing than <span class="game-skill">Medtech</span>-ing. Of course this leads into a different character generation system but that is for a later debate.</div>
<br class="">
<div class="">Here is what I would do to change the <span class="game-term">Special Abilities</span>. I think this makes them a little more useful and appealing to players. I will first state what the main book description is and then I will add how this should effect the game system. Like <span class="game-skill">Combat Sense</span>, I feel the <span class="game-term">Special Ability</span> should give a bonus to other skills, making a career class have an advantage over other careers. Also every character should start play with their <span class="game-term">Rep</span> equal to half their <span class="game-term">Special ability</span>, unless otherwise written.</div>
<br class="">
<div class="">Purchasing <span class="game-term">Special Abilities</span> should cost more, especially for levels above 5. Up to level 5 it is a one for one cost of skill points. Level 6 costs 7(5+2), level 7 costs 9(5+4), level 8 costs 13(5+8), level 9 costs 21(5+16), and level 10 costs 37(5+32). These costs are only for beginning the character and doesn't modify IP costs. This system allows NPCs and PCs who've been around to be more experienced than newbies.</div>
<br class="">
<div class="">Also every career starts with contact points just like a <span class="game-career">Fixer</span>. All careers get their ability<sup>2</sup> in points. There are a few <span class="game-term">Special Ability</span> that give more. Look at the Ability to find out how much more.<a name="Special Abilities"></a></div>
<br class=""><br class="">
<div style="font-weight:bold" class=""><h2><span class="game-term"><a name="Special Abilities"></a>Special Abilities</span></h2></div>

<br class=""><br class="">
<div class=""><h2>Authority (Cop)</h2></div>
<div class="">The ability to intimidate or control others through your position as a lawman. This attribute represents the Cop's ability to call on the forces of the law and government to get what he wants. Cops can use <i>Authority</i> to question suspects, arrest wrongdoers, and defend innocents. Backed by the power of<i> Authority</i> a cop can arrest, detain, confiscate, and enter nearly anywhere, as long as he has the proper arrest and search warrants to back his play. However,<i> Authority</i> is only as good as the guy holding badge-if the cop appears uncertain of his <i>Authority</i>, there's a good chance he'll get nailed by the people he's trying to confront. The higher your<i> Authority</i>, the more able you are to face down criminals, particularly high level mobsters and officials. <i>Authority</i> is applied to your <span class="game-stat">COOL</span> stat.</div>
<div class=""><h4>What this means to me and how I would improve it:</h4> Well, <i>Protect &amp; Serve </i>helped define what a cop is, what the laws are, who the bad guys are, what equipment the law has, and what he can or can't do. This book has some useful info and some useful rules, but it doesn't explain, in game play how to use the <i>Authority</i> ability. I would allow a bonus of a third (round down) of the ability to the skills <i>Intimidate, Streetwise, Interrogation,</i> and<i> Persuasion &amp; Fast Talk.</i> I would also give the cop a bonus of half their <i>Authority</i> to initiative because cops have combat training, not as good as solos, but enough to stand up in a fight. Cops should have informants just like a Fixer. I suggest using the same rules in <i>Wildside</i> for contact generation but only half the amount of points a Fixer would get(Ability<sup>2</sup> x Ability<sup>2</sup>/2). These are not in addition to the points stated above for contacts.</div>
<div class="">This ability should also be like the Corp's <i>Resource</i> special ability. The Cop can use this ability to acquire equipment and personal to use as they see fit ( as long as it's legal). So what equipment can they get? That really depends on the Ref. I suggest setting a cash amount to a Difficulty value. Let say Easy(10)=1-5,000 eb., Average(15)=5,oo1-25,000 eb., Difficult (20)=25,001-100,000 eb., Very Difficult(25)=100,001-500,000 eb., Nearly Impossible(30)=500,001+ eb.. Also the cop can add their <i>Leadership</i> or <i>Fast Talk + Persuasion </i>skills to the roll. Of course these values can change if the Cop goes to a superior to help acquire the equipment. This also requires that the Cop is still employed with a city/government/corporation. There is also a restriction on the availability of the equipment. Excellent and Common availability is always available. Poor availability is a Difficult(20) test to acquire. Rare items are Nearly Impossible(30) to get. And finally how many personnel the Cop can call for is based on their Special Ability. Just square the level of <i>Authority</i> and that is the number of men the Cop is able to call for. This is how much backup he can call for without going to a superior.</div>
<div class="">Now this gives Cops an edge over edgerunnners. I give them more or less what a Cop should have. Most of these changes depends on if their still in the force. If they're unemployed then the resources are not accessible. This gives the Ref some control on whether they would like the Cop to have all those goodies.</div>
<br class=""><br class="">
<div class=""><h2>Charismatic Leadership (Rockers)</h2></div>
<div class=""> This skill allows the Rocker to sway crowds equal to his level squared times 200. This ability(added to your <span class="game-stat">COOL</span> stat) allows the Rockerboy to control, incite, and charm large number of people through his or her performance skills. When under the Rocker's control, this group can easily be persuaded to act on his suggestions; for example, a Rocker could convince a concert crowd to riot in the streets or attack a heavily fortified police line. <i>Charismatic Leadership</i> will only work with groups of ten or more people as it is primarily a mob leadership ability. The higher your <i>Charismatic Leadership</i>, the larger a crowd you can control and the more direct and complex the instructions you can get them to follow. For example, a Level +3<i> Leadership</i> could incite a nightclub crowd to get rowdy. A level +5 or +6 could provoke a concert crowd of thousands to trash a neighborhood, if the area wasn't too far from the hall. At Level +9, and higher, you have the same sort of mesmeric ability as an Adolph Hitler-you can raise armies, start movements, and destroy nations.</div>
<div class=""><h4>What this means to me and how I would improve it:</h4> This ability is pretty well defined in game mechanics. I would give the Rocker a bonus of half <i>Charismatic Leadership</i> to his <i>perform</i> skill(round down).</div>
<div class="">They also get a bonus to <i>Social </i>and <i>Seduction</i> of a third of their <i>Charismatic Leadership.</i> This is because of all the parties they attend being a rock star.</div>
<div class="">As an extra bonus I would allow the Rocker musical equipment equal to half their <i>Charismatic Leadership</i> times 500 eb. This money should only be used for musical instruments, which includes cyber implants for vocals.</div>
<br class=""><br class="">
<div class=""><h2>Combat Sense (Solo)</h2></div>
<div class="">allows the Solo to perceive danger, notice traps, and have an almost unearthly ability to avoid harm. Your <i>Combat Sense</i> gives you a bonus on both your<i> Awareness/Notice</i> skill and your initiative equal to your level in the<i>Combat Sense</i> skill.</div>
<div class=""><h4>What this means to me and how I would improve it:</h4> This ability makes the Solo a god in combat. This is also the what makes players attracted to this career. There are a couple things I would give solos.</div>
<div class="">The bonus for <i>Awareness/Notice</i> would only be half their ability, not the full amount. Just because they are on the edge doesn't mean they should be able to see near impossible things so freakin easily.</div>
<div class="">A Solo can specialize in one combat skill equal to a third of their<i> Combat Sense</i>. The Solo can choose from<i> Light, Medium Heavy, Very Heavy Handgun, Light, Medium, Heavy SMG, Sniper Rifle, Assault Rifle, Shotgun, Bow, Crossbow, Brawling, Sword, Knife,&nbsp; Martial Arts, Club, Improvised weapon, or a specific Heavy Weapon(MGs, Grenades, etc.).</i> This will give the Solo a good selling point.</div>
<div class="">Finally I would give the Solo 500 eb in cyberware per point of <i>Combat Sense</i>. This gives the Solo a bit of a background. This cyberware is installed without surgery costs. The Solo doesn't get any money for any parts he gets rid of. So if they get an eye implant they don't get any money for the eye they had replaced.</div>
<br class=""><br class="">
<div class=""><h2>Credibility (Media)</h2></div>
<div class="">This is the ability to be believed: by your viewers, by the police, by important and powerful people. This is critical to getting your story heard and acted upon, as well as convincing people to tell you things, give you information, or get you into where the story is really happening. The higher your <i>Credibility</i>, the more people you can convince, and the easier it is to convince high level authorities of the truth of your information. With a level +3 <i>Credibility</i>, you can convince most people of minor scandals. With a level +5 or +6, you can convince local officials of military atrocities, undercover dealings and other front page stuff. At level +9, you can successfully expose a scandal of Watergate proportions, or convince the President of the EuroMarket Finance Board that aliens are secretly influencing world leaders. <i>Credibility</i> applies to your INT stat.</div>
<div class=""><h4>What this means to me and how I would improve it:</h4> This skills is described but not given any game mechanics to use the skill. So here is my interpretation of what it does. The Media starts with a Rep equal to the <i>Credibility</i> level. Most of the more popular anchors and reporters are known quite well by the populace.</div>
<div class="">The Media has a bonus to <i>Fast Talk/Persuasion, Interview</i>, and<i> Oratory</i> skills. The bonus is equal to 1/3 of the <i>Credibility</i> level. This is what I believe the description implies. The Media should get bonus to<i> Library Search</i> and <i>Streetwise</i> equal to <i>Credibility</i>. This is because of the many years and resources the Media uses to break a story or find one.</div>
<div class="">Also the Media gains contacts as a Fixer from the Wildside sourcebook. They get the same amount of points to use as Fixer does</div>
<div class="">If the character is a reporter for a corporation then <i>Credibilty</i> can be used as a Resource skill. This is only as good as along as the Media is part of the corporation.</div>
<br class=""><br class="">
<div class=""><h2>Family (Nomad)</h2></div>
<div class=""> This is the ability to call upon the resources and help of any of the members of the Nomad's large, extended tribal family. This can be in the form of weapons, cash, information, or small army of relatives. The threat of a Nomad family's vengeance may in itself stop harm to the Nomad. The higher your <i>Family</i> ability, the more important you are to the Family and the more help you can call upon. With a <i>Family</i> status of +2, you might be able to get several of the pack to help you wreck a town, for example. With a <i>Family</i> status of +7 or +8, you are able to make major Pack decisions and lead troops. At +10, you may<u> be</u> the Leader of your Pack. <i>Family</i> is applied to your Intelligence stat.</div>
<div class=""><h4>What this means to me and how I would improve it:</h4> This skill is described in the sourcebook for Nomads, Neotribes. It talks about what it can be done with it. I would also give a bonus of 1/3rd<i> Family</i> ability to <i>Social</i> and <i>Leadership</i> skills.</div>
<br class=""><br class="">
<div class=""><h2>Interface (Netrunner)</h2></div>
<div class="">This skill reflects the Netrunner's ability to manipulate Interface programs, and is the Skill used when operating Menu functions such as Locate Remote, Run Software, Control Remote, Downlink, Load, Create and Delete. Other players can enter the Net, but cannot use the Menu. Interface is based on the INT Stat. Note for <i>Cyberpunk 1 </i>players- you may elect to swap your original INT and <span class="game-stat">REF</span> stats for characters generation with the old rule.</div>
<div class=""><h4>What this means to me and how I would improve it:</h4> Well I have the belief that this skill could be divide into 2 separate skills. One skill for all careers and the other just for Netrunners. The skill for all careers would allow the person to run the net and use the menu. This skill would be called<i> Hacking</i>. <i>Hacking</i> would be used as Interface for Anti-Personnel Attacks. The player cannot use this skill for Remotes, locate or control. They need the <i>Control Remote</i> skill if they wish to do this. The other skill for Netrunners is sorta like <i>Combat Sense</i> in the Net. This would be retain the name <i>Interface</i>. It would have the same abilities as it did before but with a few additions.</div>
<div class="">First the Netrunner would gain a bonus to their initiative equal to half their level in <i>Interface</i>. AI also get this bonus using their<i> Interface</i> skill. This makes the Netrunner a god in the net.</div>
<div class="">And finally the Netrunner gets to write programs before play starts. This is to show that they didn't spend all their time on the Net. They get their skill double then sqaured, just like figuring out how many conatct points fixers get. This number is the number of hours a Netrunner gets to make programs. The only thing is the difficulty level of one of these programs cannot be greater than their INT, <span class="game-stat">LUCK</span>, and <i>Programming </i>skill combined.</div>
<br class=""><br class="">
<div class=""><h2>Jury Rig (Techie)</h2></div>
<div class=""> This general repair skill allows the Techie to temporarily repair or alter anything for 1D6 turns per level of skill. This is not a permanent repair; after the elapsed time, the <i>Jury Rig</i> will break down.</div>
<div class=""><h4>What this means to me and how I would improve it:</h4> This skill has been well defined for game use. But 1D6 turns seems to be a little limited. I would expand it to 1D6 times the square of the <i>Jury Rig</i> level i.e. a Jury Rig 6 gives the repair a duration of 1D6 x 36 turns or 1D6 x6 minutes.</div>
<div class="">The Techie should get a bonus of 1/3rd <i>Jury Rig</i> level add to the skills<i> Aero Tech, AV Tech, Basic Tech, Cyber Tech, Electronics, Gyro Tech</i>, and <i>Weapon Tech</i>. This makes a Techie a very valuable part of a edgerunner team.</div>
<div class="">A Techie also gets tech tools totaling 500 eb/ level of <i>Jury Rig</i>. The Tech can also buy broken goods and repair them for 3/4 price or less. Depending on the complexity of the device, the referee assigns a difficulty number. The higher the difficulty number the lower the cost for the item in question.&nbsp;<a name="Medical Tech(Medtech):"></a></div>
<br class="">
<br class="">
<div class=""><h2>Medical Tech (Medtech)</h2></div>
<div class="">This is the skill used to perform major surgery and medical repairs. For more descriptions of this skill in action, see <i>Trauma Team</i> pg. 116.</div>
<div class=""><h4>What this means to me and how I would improve it:</h4> <i>Medtech</i> skill is simple and easily used by the characters. Now the challenge is to improve it but keep it a little realistic and believable. I would give the Medtechie a bonus of 1/3rd <i>Medtech</i> to the skills <i>Human Perception, Diagnosis Illness,</i> and <i>Pharmaceutical</i>. The skill <i>Library Search</i> would get a bonus of of <i>Medtech</i>, but only if researching information about the medical field.</div>
<div class="">As long as the Medtcehie is Licensed, which requires a SIN, they can acquire medical supplies at a discount. I use the system in Wildside on pg. 52 for determining the price on any medical supplies, includes pharmaceuticals or surgery equipment. Cyberware can also be bought for a cheaper price. This cyberware can't be anything illegal or black market.</div>
<div class="">Lastly if the medtech works for a corporation they could use their <i>medtech</i> ability as a <i>Resource</i> skill, using it for perks the corporation might offer. Things like cars, apartments, etc., nothing to high tech or combat related.</div>
<br class=""><br class="">
<div class=""><h2>Resources (Corporate)</h2></div>
<div class=""> This represents the Corporate's ability to command resources. It is used as a persuasion skill, based on the scale of resources requested. This could include bodyguards, weapons, vehicles, buildings, money, etc. Obviously, the more powerful the Corporate, the more he can call upon at any one time. Your level of <i>Resources</i> determines exactly how much you can request from the Corporation without overreaching yourself. A <i>Resource</i> ability of +2 might get you access to a company car. An ability of +6 might allow you to use a Company jet or hire a Solo team from Corporate Security Division. A<i> Resource</i> of +9 would allow you access to almost all levels of the Corporation, as well as the ability to requisition almost any Company resource. Your <i>Resource</i> ability is applied to your INT stat.</div>
<div class=""><h4>What this means to me and how I would improve it:</h4> Well this is the skill to have if money is what you want. This skill is related to the corporation the corp is part of. A corp can start with apartment/residence, car, clothes, and other equipment that a referee will allow. The total of all this is equal to the corp's resource ability squared times 500. This money is only given if the corp is working. If the corp is not employed they they don't get this. I</div>
<div class="">A corp also gets a bonus to <i>Fast Talk/Persuasion, Social, Wardrobe + Style,</i> and <i>Personal Grooming</i> skills equal to 1/3rd their <i>Resource</i> ability. This is from the bach stabbing, well dressing, and smooshing a corp needs to do to rise in rank.</div>
<div class="">A Corp also gets contacts like a Fixer but with half the points to spend.</div>
<div class="">Finally a Corp can call on the resources of the corporation. The Corp can use this ability to acquire equipment and personal to use as they see fit. So what equipment can they get? That really depends on the Ref. I suggest setting a cash amount to a Difficulty value. Let say Easy(10)=1-5,000 eb., Average(15)=5,oo1-25,000 eb., Difficult (20)=25,001-100,000 eb., Very Difficult(25)=100,001-500,000 eb., Nearly Impossible(30)=500,001+ eb.. Also the corp can add their <i>Leadership</i> or<i> Fast Talk + Persuasion</i>(note: the bonus that <i>Resource </i>gives this skill is not added) skills to the roll. There is also a restriction on the availability of the equipment. Excellent and Common availability is always available. Poor availability is a Difficult(20) test to acquire. Rare items are Nearly Impossible(30) to get. And finally how many personnel the Corp can call for is based on their Special Ability. Just square the level of <i>Resource</i> and that is the number of men the Corp is able to call for.</div>
<br class=""><br class="">
<div class=""><h2>Sneak (Prowler)</h2></div>
<div class=""> ..which acts as a kind of counter balance to the <i>Combat Sense</i> ability enjoyed by Solos. Since Solos&nbsp; have their <i>Combat Sense</i> added to their <i>Awareness</i> skills(on top of any cyberware bonuses), it seems nearly-impossible to escape a Solo's notice. Prowlers live to confound Solos, since their special ability adds to their <i>Stealth</i> or <i>Hide/Evade </i>(GM's choice). This reflects a Prowler's ability to sneak into anything and steal what they are after.</div>
<div class=""><h4>What this means to me and how I would improve it:</h4> First off, I give both <i>Hide/Evade</i> and <i>Stealth</i> 3/4 bonus to both. This allows the prowler the ability to avoid those pesky solos. I would also give them a bonus of half their level in <i>Electronic Security</i> and <i>Pick Lock</i>. If they are so great in at hiding that's fine but they also are suppose to be able to break into anything too. The prowler would also get their <i>Sneak</i> ability as a bonus to their <i>Streetwise</i> when they need to fence their stolen goods.</div>
<br class=""><br class="">
<div class=""><h2>Streetdeal (Fixer)</h2></div>
<div class=""> This is the ability to deal with the underground information network. With<i> Streetdeal</i>, a Fixer can uncover rumors and information, locate missing persons or things, put gossip out on the Street, pick up clues and score big deals. The higher your <i>Streetdeal</i> ability, the more information you can gather about things happening around you, the more informants you have, and more secretive the information you can dig up. A level +3 <i>Streetdeal</i> can get you contacts for weapons, tools, or minor illegal operations. At level +5, you can penetrate the secrets of all but the most powerful crime families. At level +9, you are the equivalent of a Mafia crimelord yourself, privy to every secret that's on the street. Apply <i>Streetdeal</i> to your <span class="game-stat">COOL</span> stat.</div>
<div class=""><h4>What this means to me and how I would improve it:</h4> Wildside sourcebook took this ability and rocked it. This is one of the reason why I thought all the special ability needed revision. I can not improve this ability or have an idea where to start. But I use all three systems from it.</div>
</div>
