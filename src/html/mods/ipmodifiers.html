I was recently thinking about IP and how much each charcater gets at the end of a game.
I was also thinking about how a character with a 3 <span class="game-stat">INT</span> learns at the same pace as a Character with a 10 INT.
The system has flaws, but it's simple.
Me, I love complexity.

So I devised a system that uses the character's <span class="game-stat">INT</span> stat and their other stats to affect how quickly they learn.
All you have to do is add the charcter's <span class="game-stat">INT</span> with the Skill's governing Stat, divide that number by 10, and you get your Learning Modifier(LM).
Now everytime the charcter acquires IP for a skill, multiply the IP by that skill's LM and you get the final IP.
This system benefits the smart (granted every character I've had in games usually has an <span class="game-stat">INT</span> of 9 or 10 for those initial skills).
