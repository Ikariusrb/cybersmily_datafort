                                <h6>Summary:</h6> This scenario uses Ianus Games' Night's Edge sourcebook and uses vampires (the real blood sucking, magic power using creature of the dark).
                                I ran this game at convention and created character (PCs) specifically for this scenario.
                                The party is a rock'n'roll band that is about to play a major gig that will lead them to bigger offers.
                                The only problem is that a vampire has fallen in love with the girl Di.
                                He has sent some of his minion to contact her but they weren't very persuasive.
                                The night the adventure begins is when the band Di'n'Lyte opens for the major head liner Circuit.
                                After the band plays they are watching Circuit play when a music executive makes them an offer to see him to make a demo and then maybe a chip contract.
                                After that the party is soon attacked by more vampire minions.
                                The party will find some clues that lead them to a bar called The Kiss.
                                The chip offers is also a way in which the vampire will make contact with Di.
                                So the vampire will give the party an offer, Di to join him forever or all of them are to die.
                                Referees just need to do a little adjusting to suit the players if they want to play their own characters.

                                "All of you are part of the group Di 'n' Lyte.
                                You have played a few small time clubs in the Night City area and have slowly made a name for yourselves.
                                Things were going alright, except for an incident last week when a couple of goth posers started a fight with Stack.
                                Nothing serious happened.
                                Then Cory fix you up with a sweet deal."

                                "You are one of two opening bands for the head lining band 'Circuit'.
                                The band that went before you was another small time band named 'Jimmy's Muscle'.
                                This is the first major gig the band has had.
                                Supposedly there is a music industry scout in the audience and opening for 'Circuit' is the start of the band's major career.
                                'Circuit' is a hot new band that's being heard around the world and they've given you a chance at opening for their first show of the U.S. Tour.
                                The show starts and you're already to kick ass.
                                You perform for an hour doing a lot of your original material, maybe one or two covers"

                            Cory needs a 30 because she's talking with Eric.
                            Those who succeed see a group of 4 goths heading towards Di.
                            Before the party reacts a bouncer grabs two of them and starts to ask for their passes (<span class="game-skill">Awareness/Notice</span> roll to hear this).
                            One of the goths hits the bouncer in the stomach stunning him, while the other goth pulls a knife and cuts the bouncer's throat.
                            The other two goths charge at Di with Stunners.
                            The goths were sent to extract Di and are not allowed to harm her in anyway.
                            Now the party and the goths roll initiative.
                            Everyone in the VIP section start to scatter away from the dying bouncer.
                            </div>
                            <div>
                            The VIP section is about 6 meters by 10 meters overlooking the stage.
                            There are to exits at either end of the room with a bar in the middle along the wall.
                            There are benches along the walls and no chairs in the middle of the floor.
                            There are about 24 other people here, all are running for the exits.
                            The other bouncers aren't going to be able to get into the room during this fight because of the crowd.
                            The goths plan is simple: stun Di and carry her out, anyone that gets in the way will be knifed
                            (if the party has a hard time with the goths have the police come in with the Ronin Assault Rifles and lay waste to the vamps).
                            <div>
                            Note to the Referee: you should not let any of the party go beyond Serious Wound Level because this may cause problems in the final conflict.
                            After the fight the party has a few moments to search the bodies before the bouncers come in with the police.
                            The police start taking statements and get medical attention to anyone one that needs it.
                            Also Eric Strada will disappear during the fight.
                            The party has few options ahead of them now.
                            They can check out The Kiss or wait till tomorrow and give Eric Strada a call.
                            But we're getting ahead of ourselves, there's a party to go to (woohoo!).
                            The party (the group not the event) have a blast and probably all wake up with hang-overs.

                            They need to take 40 points of damage before being incapacitated.
                            Their limbs can take 9 points before becoming useless.
                            After 20 points of damage for every 2 points more of damage they get a -1 penalty to every action until healed.
                            They make Death Saves (8) but become immobile for d10+10 minutes if they fail the save.
                            Stun Saves are normal. They don't suffer any of the Stat penalties for being wounded.
                            The players must totally destroy, because they won't surrender or give up.

                            <div>
                            They still make stun saves.
                            All skill rolls are at 12, BTM is -3, Saves are at 8, and their <span class="game-stat">REF</span> are 8.
                            They are wearing dark armored clothes with SP10, they are armed with Tasers (stun at -2/hit) and Spawn blades (), a couple of ebs, a wallet with ID (Joe Shmoe1, 2, 3, and4), and a stamp mark on their hands.
                            If players make a successful <span class="game-skill">Streetwise/Streetdeal</span> roll they know that this mark is from the bar The Kiss.
                            It's used to marked people who want to re-enter the bar.
                            Also give a recognizable description of each goth so the player can use it when they investigate at The Kiss.

                            <div>
                            If the party does any research they will find out that Eric Strada is a music exec at DMS.
                            <span class="game-skill">Streetdeal</span> roll will tell the party member that Strada signed up a group last year that became a big hit for one album and then disappeared.
                            The band was another one hit wonder that came and went with no memory of why people listen to them.
                            No one knows what became of them or where they are now. (Let’s just say a blood sucker got them, but the party will never find out.
                            It's a good red herring for the party to follow until they get to the dead end
                            </div>
                            <div>
                            When they call Strada he will be in his office and wants the party to come on down to DMS so he can show them DMS's facilities.
                            If the party goes to DMS Strada will show them around.
                            He will also discuss the deal. First he needs them to make a demo.
                            They'll will have access to the DMS studio for this.
                            Strada will deduct the demo cost from their record contract when it comes through.
                            The party needs to make <span class="game-skill">Perform</span> and/or <span class="game-skill">Play Instrument</span> rolls when they make the demo.
                            Also the party should make a <span class="game-skill">Human Perception</span> roll vs. A Diff of 20 to notice that Strada is holding something back and is anxious about something.
                            Once they have a demo, Strada tells the party he needs to take the demo to his bosses to get the go ahead to start laying down track for their first professional music chip.
                            This will take him a day or so, so the party and let loose into the world.
                            </div>
                            <div>
                            The next day the party will get a call from Strada.
                            If the party calls him before this they will not be able to get in touch with him but will be able to leave a voice mail for him.
                            </div>
                            <div>
                            Strada will tell the party that his boss gave him the go ahead for Di 'n' Lyte to start laying down tracks.
                            Strada will arrange for some studio time right away.
                            When the party gets have them make some more <span class="game-skill">Perform/Play Instrument</span> rolls.
                            After a days’ worth of playing they will have 1 or 2 songs done and some tracks for others started.
                            The creation of the album will take a while.
                            After the first day Strada tells the group that they're invited to a party in three days to meet some of the other bands and execs from DMS.
                            This will be a get to know DMS party for the group. Hob-knob stuff.
                            The players should make a <span class="game-skill">Human Perception</span> roll to notice that Strada is anxious while inviting them to the party and relieved when they accept.
                            </div>
                            <div>
                            The next couple of days the party will be laying down more tracks and stuff like that (make more rolls).
                            The night before the party they will encounter a little snag see part 4.

                            <div>
                            This part has two section.
                            A. during the day &amp; B. during the night.
                            If the players do any research they will find out that the Kiss is owned by Alan Kenny Algoth.
                            It is THEE main hang out for goths and vamps in the Night City area.
                            It has been there since Night City was built back at the turn of the millennium.
                            The owner has owned it since it was first built.
                            The owner is known to be a recluse and lives out in Beaverville (the burbs for Night City).
                            The party will not be able to get in contact with Algoth.
                            Algoth is a net junkie and his house is a death trap w/ attack remotes.
                            If the party does decide to pay Algoth a visit Alan won't be too pleased with people investigating him.
                            Algoth is a borderline cyberpycho and will kill the party if they come onto his property (and he has the law behind him on this one.
                            Trespassing is taken very seriously in the burbs).
                            You can have the party fight an army of drones armed with assault rifles and armored to the teeth.
                            If the party survives good for them, but Algoth will be making a run against the NCPD datafort any place the players pictures into the CSWAT most wanted file.
                            He will then call said CSWAT and then the party is seriously in trouble. "Cie la vie"
                            </div>
                            <div>
                            A. the Kiss during the day has a few patrons.
                            The general atmosphere is a dark cold place.
                            The space is very confining.
                            The Kiss is a series of small 4 meter by 4 meter rooms linked together with three entrances in each room.
                            There are 12(3x4) rooms on the bottom floor and 9(3x3) upstairs.
                            The first floor is connected to the second floor by spiral stairs in 4 of the rooms.
                            There are bars in the 4 corner rooms on both floors.
                            The main entrance is on the first floor through the middle of the three row part of the building.
                            There is a downstairs basement but the party should not be able to get access to it no matter what.
                            </div>
                            <div>
                            When the party goes into The Kiss during the day there will be about 11 people here and about 3 of the bars are opened
                            (2 downstairs, 1 upstairs).
                            If the party ask about the goths they will get nowhere, but have the party make some <span class="game-skill">interview</span>, <span class="game-skill">interrogate</span>, or <span class="game-skill">intimidate</span> rolls depending on how the party approaches the bartenders/patrons.
                            They can also make some <span class="game-skill">Human Perception</span> rolls to tell if the people they are talking to are holding back anything.
                            If they roll over a 25 they will tell that the person is nervous, mainly because they'll think the group are cops
                            (and everyone has something to hide in Night City).

                            If the players show up and aren't dressed for the occasion they will find it near impossible to get anything from the patrons (Diff 40 vs. Social skills).
                            For the bartenders the Diff is 30.
                            If their dress then the Diff are lowered by 10 if they were successful with their dress rolls.
                            But they must throw down some money for any answers from the bartenders.
                            If the party succeeds then they will be directed to a waitress that was working that night.

                            Saw all of them leave together soon after, never saw them again. She never saw the suit before and if the party gives her a description of Strada she'll be clueless on that one.
                            The players can make <span class="game-skill">Human perception</span> roll to see if she's holding back anything (which she won't be).
                            They will notice that she is anxious on a roll of 20 or better (the party is keep her away from customers and their tips).
                            She doesn't know anything else.
                            The Party can make <span class="game-skill">Awareness/Notice</span> rolls and need a 30 to see a gentleman watching them the whole time they are in the bar.

                            Depending on what the players do they will be confront by a gang of 5 goths.
                            The goths are to beat the hell out of the party (except Di of course).
                            These guys are normal mortals. Once 3 of them are dead the rest must make <span class="game-stat">COOL</span> rolls vs 15 or the remaining two try an escape from the party.
                            If the party stuns any of them.
                            The goths will tell the party some guy offered them a G each to rough the players up except Di.
                            The Goth also tells them the guy was wearing a dark red trench coat and long black hair with a strip on the left side.
                            After the goth reveals this he dies by a gunshot to the head.
                            The gun shot was silenced and the players need to make an <span class="game-skill">Awareness/Notice</span> roll vs Diff 20 to get a general area where the shot came from.
                            If they succeed, they notice a shadow running away.
                            They won't be able to catch the culprit but have the players make a roll any ways to make them feel like they had a chance.

                            If the roll succeeds then the party knows they are being followed.
                            They are being followed by a vampire hunter named Marcus Gilmen a.k.a Stake.
                            Marcus is on the trail of a vampire and knows Di is his next victim.
                            He doesn't know who or where he can find the vampire.
                            Marcus knows that there is a vampire involved with The Kiss and uses the patrons to do his bidding.
                            Marcus wants to keep his distance from the party until he can find the vampire by watching them.

                            There is one thing Marcus can't stand besides vampires and that is mortals who pretend they are those evil black creatures.
                            Marcus will be heading to Jilly's Jiggle to confront Nightshade before the party will be able to talk to him.

                            Marcus will not tell the party who he is, but that he knows things that will help them.
                            They need to come to his apartment's address to discuss this further if they want to live.
                            Marcus won't give them any more info.
                            If the party goes to his apartment they will find it broken into.
                            They will discover the corpse of Marcus with all his blood drained from him.
                            The party will also find the room with a few pictures of the party, some pictures of The Kiss, and some of different Goths.
                            There is also a small portable computer smashed.
                            Players can make a <span class="game-skill">Jury Rig</span> roll vs. Diff of 25 to be able to access any information on the computer.
                            If the player succeeds they will find a lot of stuff about a vampire in Night City.
                            News reports of victims with their blood totally drained from their bodies.
                            Eye witness accounts of a man able to fly, stop bullets from hitting him, throwing lightning, and other bizarre events.

                            By the same Goths from part 3.
                            All the players except Di will be attacked to the death unless, as stated above, they're stunned in which case they will tell the party that they were hired by a corp to have them killed and the Goths will die the same way as above once they reveal this.

                            <div>
                            Now the party and final encounter with Gunther Harrington the very old vampire that has fallen in love with Di.
                            The house they go to is in a well secured are in the burbs.
                            There will be guards at the driveway gates and will be ushered through.
                            The players can make an <span class="game-skill">Awareness/notice</span> rolls vs Diff 20 to know there isn't a party going on yet.
                            When the players go to the door, Strada will answer it and invites them in.
                            Eric will tell the players that they are early and that Mr Harrington wants to talk to them before the rest of the guest start showing up.
                            He will then offer those drinks and heads into a very large living room with a staircase and balcony.
                            Strada will fix the party a bunch of drinks and tell them to make themselves comfortable and that Harrington will be down in a few minutes.
                            </div>
                            <div>
                            After a little while the party should make <span class="game-skill">Awareness/Notice</span> roll vs Diff 20 to hear someone coming into the front door(on a 25 they hear there are more than one person there).
                            A group of Goths come walking into the living room.
                            Strada is at easy, the party can make <span class="game-skill">Human Perception</span> vs 15 to notice this.
                            Those players who took drinks should make a <span class="game-skill">Resist Torture/Drugs</span> vs 15.
                            If they fail they are at a -5 penalty to all rolls.
                            If the players are dumbfounded then they're in for a world of hurt.
                            At the same time the Goths come walking in Harrington will be coming down the stairs.
                            The first person to do something will be the first one hit with Harringtons power (Lightning is the best effect to cow the party).
                            Once this happens Harrington will tell the party that he wish Di to join him as is consort and will spare the rest of the party's lives.
                            Now if the party start anything the Goths will try to incapacitate the party (they were instructed to do so),
                            Strada will hide behind the bar until the whole thing is over, and Strada is out to kill everyone but Di.
                            This is the final conflict and should be a bloody fight.
