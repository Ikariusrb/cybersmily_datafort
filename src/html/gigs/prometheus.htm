                            <h5>By Will Piedmont</h5>
                            <h6>Introduction:</h6>
		                    <div>
		                    This series of scenarios is based on a campaign I did awhile back.
		                    I have recently split them into bite size nuggets to run them at cons.
		                    I use the Night City sourcebook heavily throughout it.
		                    If you don't have it, I'm deeply sorry for you, but it is not necessary to run it.
		                    Most of the team the players are after are on my web site.
		                    If this is a problem, I suggest changing their skills around or even changing their names.
		                    Or don't mention it to the players.
		                    In any event I hope you enjoy.
		                    </div>
		                    <div>
		                    The campaign is about an AI seeking to become human.
		                    It had the black ops team of the company it was working for steal it.
		                    The players are sent on the trail of the team to recover stolen goods and the team.
		                    The company will not tell the players thta they're after an AI.
		                    </div>
		                    <div>
		                    This is a good scenario for Solos, nomads, ex-cops, medtechies, and techies.
		                    A fixer or corp can be integrated, either they work for Silent Sue or the Corporation.
		                    Netrunners aren't going to well suited for this game until later.
		                    I would suggest having players who's character dies later in the campaign to roll up a netrunner.
		                    </div>
		                    <div>
		                    This was a very cool campaign.
		                    Several parties of players went through it.
		                    Whenever a group died another one would take over where the first one left off.
		                    Some players might not like that, but too bad for them.
		                    Life's hard in the dark future. You live fast and die faster.
		                    </div>
		                    <div>
		                    NPC will have their skills number with a slash and then a higher number.
		                    The second number is the combined skill and stat.
		                    Most cyberware will be already added to the stats and skills.
		                    </div>
		                    <h4>Beginning of the scenario</h4>
		                    <br />
		                    <blockquote>
		                    A fixer by the name of Silent Sue, hires each of you for a job she needs done.
		                    You have all done jobs for Silent Sue in the past and she is a reliable contact.
		                    She tells you to meet her at the usual place, a bar known as the Night Owl.
		                    The Night Owl is located at the top of Bay Ridge Residential Hotel in the Ed Center of Night City.
		                    The place is one of the only places in the city that still serves real beer.
		                    Everyone minds their own business, so there's no unexpected incidences.
		                    </blockquote>
		                    <blockquote>
		                    When you arrive Silent Sue is sitting at her usual booth, the only one that is reserved everyday for her.
		                    You see her bodyguard, Mandy hanging out at the bar.
		                    Silent Sue is not sitting alone though.
		                    A man in his mid-thirties dress in a suit, probably Takanaka from the way it fits him.
		                    It's always funny to see a corp sitting next to Silent Sue because of the edge look she's got.
		                    As you approach she nods to you to wait for a sec.
		                    The corp and her seems to be discussing things.
		                    After a minute she calls you over.
		                    </blockquote>
		                    <blockquote>
		                    "Everybody, this is Mr. Noname.
		                    He has a proposition for all of you and it has the potential of making all you better off financial.
		                    Have a seat and listen to what he's got to say."
		                    Silent Sue gets up and lets all of you sit.
		                    She then heads over to bar so you and the corp can hash out the details.
		                    </blockquote>
		                    <blockquote>
		                    The corp smiles.
		                    "I want to thank you all for coming.
		                    The job I have is a missing persons.
		                    A team from my corporation went rogue 5 months ago in Boston.
		                    They stole something before they left.
		                    Plus they failed their contracts they had with us, and left us.... at a financial lose from certain benefits they were given."
		                    The corp pulls out an e-book and slides it over to you.
		                    "During a recent news story on Net54, a story on a demonstration turned riot here in Night City was aired.
		                    A man calling himself Dango was caught on film.
		                    We believe he is still in Night City and the rest of the team he was with might be here too.
		                    If not, he might know where they are."
		                    The ebook shows the footage of the incident.
		                    A close up of a man in the crowd is shown.
		                    He is seen with two other men.
		                    During the footage, Dango and these men start fighting with some of the protesters.
		                    The crowd becomes a riot between protesters and onlookers and then the police join the mix.
		                    The footage loses Dango when it looks like a rioter slams the camera with a baseball bat.
		                    The corp continues
		                    "From what Silent Sue has told me those men with Dango are wearing the colors of the local gang called the Maelstrom.
		                    The next file in the ebook shows you the
		                    <a href="/gigs/dossier" target="_blank">dossier</a>
		                    of the rest of the rogue team.
		                    My corporation is willing to pay a bounty of 30,000eb per team member.
		                    Plus, if you retrieve the equipment they stole, there's a bonus of 100,000eb.
		                    If you find all the team plus the equipment we're willing to pay a total of &frac12; a million eb.
		                    From what Silent Sue has told me you are all professionals.
		                    So I expect you to be discrete on this whole matter. No police or media involvement.
		                    We are also willing to give you a cash advance of 5,000eb to your team. Is there any questions?"
		                    The corp sits back and lights a cigarette.
		                    </blockquote>
		                    <br />
		                    <div>
		                    If any of the players use their Human Perception, they will feel that he's not telling the whole story but he's seems to be honest on his offer.
		                    If the players ask for any equipment instead of cash the corp can only offer drugs at a lower price.
		                    He'll mention that the corporation he works for has medical interest and leave it at that.
		                    If the player ask for any cyberware or Bioware, the corp will tell them it will take to long and Dango might be out of the city by then.
		                    </div>
		                    <div>
		                    If asked about getting in contact with him.
		                    He'll tell them to go through Silent Sue.
		                    She's the contact person for both sides.
		                    </div>
		                    <div>
		                    If the players try and spike up the price they need to make a <em>Streetwise, Streetdeal, or Resource</em> roll versus a Diff of 20.
		                    For each point over 20, the corp is willing to go 1% over the price.
		                    If asked about killing the team, the corp will tell them they would prefer them to be alive, if not they must hand over the entire body.
		                    He'll mention something about certain equipment that belongs to the corporation and that the party should not take it.
		                    If they do, the corporation will consider them a rogue team too and will hire more teams to deal with the party.
		                    After the questioning is done the corp will leave the e-book and throw down several debit cards, equaling the agreed upon upfront price.
		                    </div>
		                    <div>
		                    Silent Sue heads over as the corp gets up.
		                    She tells him they will be in contact.
		                    Then she sits down with the party.</div>
		                    <br />
		                    <blockquote>"So you choombas need anything from me?"</blockquote>
		                    <br />
		                    <div>
		                    Silent Sue has many connections, including a weapon smuggler.
		                    She can get the party most equipment.
		                    Including some military hardware if needed.
		                    She arranges for the players to meet a fixer by the name of China at the bar called Slammers.
		                    Anything else besides weapons or armor, she'll direct them to either Vulture, who hangs out at Grand Illusion, or the Bag Lady which they can find her in the park.
		                    </div>
		                    <div>
		                    If asked about the Maelstrom...
		                    </div>
		                    <br />
		                    <blockquote>
		                    "The Maelstrom has a hang out at the old Barley's, near the stadium.
		                    I wouldn't try nabbing him there if he's tight with any of them.
		                    Their serious chromers.
		                    Their leader, Hammer, is a born again cyberpyscho.
		                    My advice, get him outside Maelstrom territory.
		                    I've seen some of them hang at the Afterlife and also up near Slammers."
		                    </blockquote>
		                    <br />
		                    <div>
		                    Now this clue about Slammers, Maelstrom, and China is on purpose.
		                    Especially if you have a time limit on running this game, like at a con, which I did.
		                    But the players might be already set and head off to Barley's to try and find and follow Dango.
		                    So here's both options.
		                    </div>
		                    <br />
		                    <h4>Barley's</h4>
		                    <div>
		                    If the party scope out Barley's, they'll definitely see Maelstrom members here.
		                    At least 5 are hanging outside at any particular time.
		                    Barley's is an old abandon shopping mall that now houses the Maelstrom gang (see the Night City sourcebook for further details, p. 47 and p.123).
		                    </div>
		                    <div>
		                    There's few options for the party.
		                    They can either wait and stake the place out, go up to the gangers and see if they can talk, or storm the hang out.
		                    The last option will get them killed.
		                    At any time there are at least 10-20 more Maelstrom inside within yelling distance.
		                    If the party tries thie last option, kill a good hunk of them.
		                    Even though I list this option, only people who want to die take it, whether they're conscious of it or not.
		                    </div>
		                    <div>
		                    Next, they can head up to the gangers to talk.
		                    The players can make a <em>Fast Talk &amp; Persuasion or Interview</em> roll.
		                    If they roll above a 15 the guards will tell them they know Dango, he's the new guy who's going to make Maelstrom stronger and richer.
		                    On a 20 or more They tell them where he can be found.
		                    On a 25 or more they try and help the players hook up with Dango.
		                    On a 30 or more they tell the party exactly where Dango is.
		                    Anything lower than a 15 they tell the party to frag off.
		                    If the party persists, the difficulty rises 5 point per try.
		                    And if the party fumbles or rolls 15 less than the Diff, the gangers will attack them.
		                    If the party doesn't run away, they'll have to deal with 10-20 more coming out of the building.
		                    Again kill or injure a player but let them escape.
		                    </div>
		                    <div>
		                    Now for the other option. If they stake the place out, let them. Have them make a couple of <em>Hide</em> rolls, like 4 or 5 of them. If any of them are low, have one of the gangers head their way but a half block before where the party is hiding, the ganger runs into his input. Make the player's paranoid. After a couple of hours they will see Dango leave with three other Maelstrom. If they jump him anywhere within a block of Maelstrom hang out, they will be attacked by 10-20 of Maelstrom. This is another stupid option that some players might take. Again Kill some of them. It's a lesson early in this series to teach them blunt force will get them killed. So think before you act.</div>

To simplify things they'll have Muscle &amp; Bone Lace, Skin weave, Optics(Lowlite, Antidazzle, Targeting scope), Processor(Smartlink, plugs, and Kerenzikov Boosterware+2). The stats have already been changed. I would suggest throwing in a couple with Cyber arms, wolvers, or big knuckles. If you want their leader to get involved, you should definitely make him up as a Heroic NPC (as Listen Up.. p.95). Make him a monster, because to be the leader of Maelstrom you gotta be.</div>

		                    When they follow Dango, they need to make a <em>Shadow/Track</em> roll.
		                    Dango will make an opposing <em>Awareness/Notice</em> roll.
		                    If Dango spots the party he'll be weary.
		                    Dango will be heading to Slammers.
		                    He's meeting with a contact.
		                    If the players follow him all the way to Slammers and follow him in go to the next section labeled Slammers.
		                    If they jump Dango before then, and Dango is surprised play it out.
		                    Dango is not going to be taken alive no matter what.
		                    With a pain editor and other cyberware he'll fight until he's dead.
		                    The ganger's with him aren't as brave.
		                    If they loose one of their numbers or Dango, they'll flee.
		                    Dango isn't that important to them.
		                    </div>
		                    <div>
		                    If Dango knows the party is following him and they move in to take him, he'll ambush them.
		                    If he knows he's being followed but the party doesn't make their move until after Slammers, he'll wait.
		                    In any case Dango will duck into an alley before the party jumps him.
		                    Once in the alley, he'll send the Maelstrom down the alley, telling them to act casual.
		                    Meanwhile, he climbs/jumps up into a fire escape and lay in ambush.
		                    If the party follows into the alley, Dango will unleash hell on them.
		                    He'll first fire his twin Malorian, taking down as many players as possible.
		                    Once empty, he'll climb the rest of the fire escape onto the building.
		                    He'll pier over to find the rest of the party.
		                    If they are close to the building, he'll jump over the side and rip one of the player up with his wolvers.
		                    The building should only be about 3 stories.
		                    With his cyberlegs, Dango should be able to make this move with no problems (Athletic roll vs a Diff of 20).
		                    Try not to kill the whole party.
		                    I've wiped out quite a few with this strategy.
		                    Only luck and some thinking saved the rest of them.
		                    If they defeat him, they 'll find all his equipment.
		                    A cell phone (no numbers are stored on it.), about 500eb in cash, no debt cards, and tickets to see a band called Pup-Pup's Prot&eacute;g&eacute;s at the Grand Illusion night club (NCSB p.116) in about a week.

		                    <div>
		                    There's a couple of reasons why the PCs will go to Slammers but the end result is the same.
		                    How ever they get there it will be the same encounter.
		                    </div>
		                    <br />
		                    <blockquote>
		                    You arrive at Slammers.
		                    Outside you see various gangers hanging outside.
		                    </blockquote>
		                    <div><br />
		                    If the players make a <em>Streetwise</em> roll DIFF of 10, they'll know that Slammers is a neutral ground for all the gangs in the city.
		                    They'll also know that there's an arena in the place if the gangs want to duke it out.
		                    </div>
		                    <blockquote>
		                    You head inside to the loud Chrome rock music that's playing.
		                    There seems to be quite a few people in the place.

		                    <div>
		                    If they head to Slammers right away and either looking for China or staking the place out read the following.
		                    </div>
		                    <br />
		                    <blockquote>
		                    You spot the woman China hanging out at the end of the bar.
		                    However she's not alone.
		                    You see a very familiar face sitting next to her.
		                    The man Dango is talking with her.
		                    Both seem to be talking about something serious.
		                    Neither smiles, but they don't seem to be hostile with each other either.
		                    After a few minutes Dango smiles at her and nods his head.
		                    He collects three Maelstroms who were hanging out a few meters away.
		                    Dango heads for the door.

		                    <br />
		                    <div>
		                    Now the players have a couple of options.
		                    </div>
		                    <div>
		                    First they can go and talk with China.
		                    If they tell her Silent Sue sent them, China will ask what they want.
		                    She start bargaining with them about price etc.
		                    If they ask her about Dango and how well she knows him, she looks at the PCs and tell them it's none of their damn business.
		                    PCs might try to use a skill to weed the info out of her.
		                    They can try either <em>Fast Talk &amp; Persuasion</em> or <em>Seduction</em>.
		                    In either case they'll need to score at least a 30.
		                    China keeps clients business private.
		                    If the PCs miraculous score higher than a 30, she say that he's looking for some equipment.
		                    Doesn't know who he is or why he's buying, just that he is.
		                    That's all she say about Dango.
		                    If the players think China is in with Dango and the rest of the people the players are looking for, they're wrong.
		                    If the party decide to threaten, attack, or ambush China, they'll have to deal with several edgerunners, mainly solos.
		                    I'm not going to write this situation up because the party shouldn't do it.
		                    If they do, they'll be hunted by a majority of edgerunners who use China to get them weapons.
		                    I would send 1-3 edgerunner team after the party each day if they harmed China in any way.
		                    </div>
		                    <div>
		                    Secondly, the players can go after Dango.
		                    Now after this meet Dango will have caught a glimpse of the party and will try an ambush them, just like I describe above.
		                    If the players aren't lured into the trap Dango will head back to Barley's and hang out there.
		                    </div>
		                    <div>
		                    Long term surveillance of Dango will show that he basically hangs out with Maelstrom.
		                    Helping them enforce their turf, selling drugs, etc.
		                    During this time, Dango will try and ambush the party.
		                    If the party is smart and stay in a nice safe location, Dango will try and find where they're sleeping and bring a few Maelstrom along to kick their asses.
		                    Again Dango will not be taken alive. So now the players should have the only lead, that of Pup-pup's Prot&eacute;g&eacute;.
		                    </div>
		                    <br />
		                    <h4>The Grand Illusion</h4>
		                    <div>
		                    Note: Dango should be dead by now.
		                    If he's not, you need to manipulate the players into action to have it done.
		                    </div>
		                    <div>
		                    This is where the players will find more of the team.
		                    Joy-Joy and Mars formed a band.
		                    They're a local band and have played a few gigs.
		                    There will be other bands on the bill and PPP will be the third band to go on.
		                    The players will in all likelihood stake the place out.
		                    If they do they can all make <em>Awareness/Notice</em> rolls versus a DIFF of 30.
		                    If they succeed they will notice a woman hanging out at the bar that has similar features to Anna.
		                    If the party approaches Anna and start up a conversation, have Anna make a <em>Human Perception</em> roll versus what every skill the player wants to use on her (<em>Social, Fast Talk &amp; Persuasion, Interview, Seduction, Perform</em>).
		                    If Anna scores higher, she will have a feeling about the player and watch them for the rest of the night.
		                    </div>
		                    <div>
		                    After PPP hits the stage, they will come out from backstage half an hour later.
		                    They will be mingling with the crowd.
		                    If the players approach them have both Mars and Joy-Joy make rolls as Anna would have.
		                    Again they'll have a feeling about the party and watch them for the rest of the night.
		                    </div>
		                    <div>
		                    During the last performance of the night.
		                    Anna will approach Joy-Joy and tell her about Dango.
		                    Dango should be dead by now.
		                    If not, you need to have the player encounter Dango before this night.
		                    After the very brief encounter Anna will leave.
		                    Mars and Joy-Joy stay until the club closes.
		                    </div>
		                    <div>
		                    If Anna is followed, the party will be brought to the New Harbor Mallplex.
		                    This is where Anna is living.
		                    She will get in contact with Big Man and tell him about Dango.
		                    In turn Big Man will tell Prometheus.
		                    Prometheus will start to investigate the death.
		                    In a couple of days Prometheus will tell Big Man that BMS has sent a team after them and the contact person for the team is Silent Sue.
		                    What happens next will be described in Part 2.
		                    </div>
		                    <div>
		                    If the party follows Joy-Joy and Mars, they'll need to make several <em>Shadow/Track</em> rolls to be able to follow them.
		                    Joy-Joy is paranoid about a lot of things and takes extra precautions to loose anybody that might be following her or Mars.
		                    Eventually the players should fail a roll and lose them.
		                    </div>
		                    <div>
		                    If any of the party confronts them. They will let it slip that
		                    <strong>"They'll never take Prometheus back! So give up the chase!"</strong>
		                    Then they'll fight the party with as much hardware as they're carrying.
		                    </div>
		                    <div>If they don't pursue them, the party will get a call from Silent Sue.</div>
		                    <br />
		                    <blockquote>
		                    "I think I got a lead on Pup Pup.
		                    A techie friend of mine thinks he spotted him down by the wharf.
		                    A guy by the name of Billy the Packrat at a place called Weird Stuff saw him.
		                    You should go and take a look."

		                    <br />
		                    <div>
		                    If the players follow this lead they'll encounter a group of Maelstrom looking for revenge.
		                    I'm sure the fight with Dango wasn't a quiet one, and somebody somewhere noticed the party.
		                    So the gang will look to knock the heads off the party.
		                    Once the gang is taken care of, the players will not have a problem from Maelstrom again.
		                    They respect force, so the players will have earned their respect for now.
		                    </div>
		                    <div>
		                    This will end the first part of series.
		                    There should be a couple of lead for the party.
		                    </div>

		                    <br />
