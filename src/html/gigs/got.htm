		                    <div>Summary: This is a scenario about affairs, blackmail, intrigue, and murder. The president of a company is murdered for insulting the honor of Arasaka and for control of his growing company. The path the party must follow is, I hope, a winding one. This scenario is broken into scenes and people. The scenes are what happens when the party goes to certain places. Then there are the people that the party will interact with and what information the NPCs have.

		                    <div>Tom was killed on June 20th, 2020 at 3pm.<br/></div>
		                    <br/>
		                    <div>SCENE 1: THE HIRING</div>
		                    <br/>
		                    <br/>
		                    <div>&nbsp; The group is call in by a man named William Davis. The party is to meet him at the Pocket Fluff Advertising Inc's office. When they arrive they are brought to Mumashi Takiko. She is a beautiful Japanese woman. She introduces herself as Mr. Davis's secretary and brings the party into his office. Mr. Davis is on the phone and quickly hangs up.<br/>
		                     &quot;Hi, my name is Mr. Davis. I have a problem that I really don't want the public to know about. My brother and CEO of this company was killed three days ago from what the police identified as a ramjet shell to the head. He was in his car at the time of the attack and was heading home. We here at Pocket Fluff Advertising pride ourselves at making satirical images of important public and private persons. We have just started a new add campaign for milk commercials. In these commercials we poke fun at some important people in the business world. Here let me show you them:&quot; He turns to a big vid screen where the commercials are displayed
		                    </div>
		                    <div>-Arasaka-crisis of where all the milk has gone. Zooms to an Arasaka plant with milk then to Saburo eating cookies and Milk. Saburo has a milk mustache during the scene. In the background there is a person being killed by a firing squad.
		                    </div>
		                    <div>-Militech- guy being tortured and then feed cookies. Breaks down and confesses</div>
		                    <div>-EBM-CEO reassigns a guy to space in a cubical. The guy is given a cake to celebrate his new job, but no milk is found on the ship, and the guy see a schedule that says the next shipment isn't for months. CEO enjoying milk and watching the guy on close circuit TV.</div>
		                    <div>-President- With an intern doing some interesting things with cake but needs to get some milk. Press is right out the door and she's completely naked with intern.</div>
		                    <div>-Drugs-a bunch of hippies hanging around smoking dope and eating brownies. Someone says to get some milk but there's none left. They go berserk.</div>
		                    <div> &quot;As you can see we may have stepped on some toes. The last commercial actually bends some FCC laws concerning the use of drugs shown on Vid. The police haven't found any leads and I'm afraid they are starting to suspect me. As far as I know my brother had no enemies but then again I didn't socialize much with him, only during work. I need you to find the killer, who hired them, and most importantly bring me physical evidence of it. I'm offering you each 5,000 eb and a bonus of 8,000 if you can do it in a week. My secretary will give you any information that you'll need. I also want the assassin killed. I loved my brother and I firmly believe in the concept of &quot;an eye for an eye&quot;. Mr. Davis hits the intercom. &quot; Mumashi please come in. She'll get you what you need. I'm sorry I can't stay and chat any longer. I have a business to run. Thank you for your help. Good day&quot;.<br/>
		                    &nbsp; Mumashi starts to shuffle you out of Mr. Davis's office. She gives the party an E-Book with a chip in it. &quot;This is the profile of Pocket Fluff and of Tom Davis. If you need anything else you may reach me at 555-9878 ext 235. You may call this number anytime of the day or night. I thought Tom was a good man. He ran the company well. Willie has been devastated by this. I didn't think Tom was into anything dangerous. If you want I can introduce you to his secretary, Maggie Evans?&quot; (While talking to Mumashi the players should make a Human Perception vs.20 to figure out that Mumashi is hiding something. On a 25 or higher they have a feeling Mumashi is lying.)<br/>

		                    <br/>
		                    <div>The party will probably use their own sources to gain any information, whether it's from a fixer or netrunner</div>
		                    <div>*(25)Finding out about the Assassin. The party will learn about an assassin called Skitter Boy who's known to use a ramjet rifle in his hits. Skitter boy is a psycho and has a rep that he's unreliable. On a 30 the party gets an address. It costs the party 3 grand up front.</div>
		                    <div>MUMASHI ASURA-SECRETARY/ARASAKA OPERATIVE</div>
		                    <div> The dirt on this chic is she is working for Arasaka to acquire control of PFI. She started by seducing Will and having an affair with him. When she found out about the DMS offers she had Tom killed and made sure that Will had the prime motive for having his brother killed.</div>
		                    <div>SPIGOT-FIXER/DRUGDEALER</div>
		                    <div>&nbsp; When the party visits Spigot he will talk to them. He like Tom and is really pissed off at whoever did him in.<br/>
		                    &nbsp; &quot;Tom was a real chipped gato. Daughter's a real bitch. She threatened to kill him on a number of occasions. Met Will once, he seemed alright. The brothers got along good from what I saw and heard. Tom was into weed and dat was it. Tried pushing him into hard stuff but refused it. Tom asked about hiring some security for him, ya know edgerunners like yourselves. Told him it would take a couple of days. Well I'm afraid it was too late, the next day he was iced. I hope you get the bastards and if you don't do him in give me a call so my boys can go to town on em.&quot;</div>
		                    <div>MALLORY DAVIS-TOM'S WIFE/TOM'S HOUSE</div>
		                    <div>&nbsp; She will be at home for the whole adventure and that's where the party can find her. Mallory is still pretty upset and will try to help the party anyway she can. She knows about Tom's drug habit but doesn't know where he got it. She doesn't know a lot about the business and can't give them much info on that.<br/>
		                    &nbsp; The morning of Tom's death him and their daughter, Lisa, got into a major screaming fight. Tom found out she was stealing from our account. Lisa told him to go to hell and that she was going to put him there. Mallory hasn't seen her daughter since that morning. Mallory will get very upset when she discusses this and be unable to talk about it any further.<br/>
		                    &nbsp; She'll allow the party to go through Tom's study. In the study they find Tom's computer. In it there is an e-mail from Jacob Marsh @DMS.com<br/>
		                    &nbsp; &quot;Hi Mr. Davis, I know you refused our first offer, but I would like to discuss this in person a little further. BTW how's your son doing in New Hampshire? I'll see you at 5 pm at the International Cafe today. Be there for your family's sake.&nbsp; Jac-&quot; This is all the party will find out here.</div>
		                    <div>MAGGIE EVANS-SECRETARY</div>
		                    <div>&nbsp; Mumashi will bring the characters to another office the secretary's desk is empty and Mumashi brings into the office where a women is typing on a keyboard with several piles of paper on the desk. There is also a box on the floor with pictures of people and little toys in it.<br/>
		                     &quot;Maggie these are private eyes looking into Tom's death. They want to ask you some questions about it&quot; Maggie nods, her mouth is filled with a pen to answer coherently. Mumashi smiles and leaves the party. Maggie will greet the party an ask them what they need to know.<br/>
		                    &nbsp; She's a gossip monger.<br/>
		                    INFORMATION SHE HAS<br/>
		                     The party needs to make some Fast Talk &amp; Persuasion, Social, Seduction, or Interview rolls to gain any of the information below. The Difficult numbers are listed with the information.</div>
		                    <div>*(10)Everything in the E-Book. She also tells the party that she has been at PFI since they came to Night City. She fears that her career might be ending but knows that there will be a big pay off to keep her mouth shut.</div>
		                    <div>*(15)She knows about DMS offer but doesn't know all of it. She'll tell the party that Tom was against it and that Will was pushing him to accept it.</div>
		                    <div>*(15)She knows about Tom's drug habit. She would often get the drugs for him from a Fixer named Spigot. (20)Tells the party must go to a bar named Lenny's. There they need to ask for a guy named Chico. When the bartender says he's not there, then they should ask for Spigot. That's the signal to tell Spigot the party is cool.</div>
		                    <div>*(15)Arasaka pulled their contract after the commercial was shown. The liaison for Arasaka and Tom had a heated argument that day. Their shouting match was heard throughout the office. Also they were arguing all the way to the elevator.</div>
		                    <div>*(20)Tells the party about Elizabeth Agatha is part of a gang, the Voodoo Boyz. She has threatened Will in the office and blames him for Tom's death. She and her father had a stormy relationship but Maggie thinks Liz really loved her father.</div>
		                    <div>*(30)Knows that there is something going on with Mumashi and Will. She thinks they're having an affair but is quite sure. She knows Mumashi is single and both of them have had late nights together. But the party didn't hear it from her (wink, wink).</div>
			                <div>SCENE 2 : ASSASSIN'S APARTMENT</div>
			                <div>
		                     The party will find a few things a miss. First they will notice an unmarked van parked outside the building.. The van has an average lock(Diff 15 vs Pick Lock or Basic Tech) to break in. It also has an alarm(Diff 20 vs Electronic Security). They will find a bill from We Rent Everything rental company for the van. The bill is charged to PFA. There is no driver and there is no other vehicle parked on this side of the street.<br/>
		                     When the party heads up to the apartment they will encounter 4 solos dressed in Blood Razor colors. The solos are just leaving the apartment. They will attack the party when spotted and will fight to the death.</div>
		                    <div>4 solos(Stats 7, Skills 7, Initiative Bonus +17)<br/>

		                    Equipment: Armored Trench(SP 16), H&amp;K MPK-11,&nbsp; Sternmeyer Type 35, a couple flash-bang grenades</div>
		                    <div> After this encounter they will find the assassin dead. The apartment is only 3 rooms(living room, bedroom, and kitchen)..They will find the ramjet rifle in his closet along with 2 Minami smg, AMT, and 4 clips for each weapon. The party needs to make an Awareness/Notice roll. On a 20+ they find a business card(Jikizu Larson, Professional Agent Scout w/ a phone number {out of order}) with writing on the back saying &quot;12am Rainbow Nights&quot;. On a 25+ roll they find a picture of the assassin and a bunch of other people including Lisa Davis. All of them are dressed in the same gang colors.<br/>
		                    &nbsp; A few minutes pass for the party to search around the apartment and then the door opens and in walks a girl carrying groceries. She drops the bag&nbsp; immediately upon seeing the party and then will attempt to flee. It shouldn't be hard for the party to restrain her. Her name is Glo and she doesn't know anything. She never asked Skitter Boy about his biz.. He told her that he was on a big job and that they were going to be rich. That is all the party will be able to get out of her.<br/>
		                    &nbsp;</div>
		                    <div><br/></div>

		                    	<div>
		                    &nbsp; If the party show up at Rainbow Nights at 12am, They will need to make Awareness/Notice roll. If they roll 20+ they notice (ta da!) Mumashi. If they roll 30+ they will also notice 2 gentlemen watching them. If the men are confronted they will play dumb. They are friends of Lisa Davis and are following the party because Lisa believes her uncle Will had Tom killed. The party will meet her later.<br/>
		                     If the party confronts Mumashi, she will smile when seeing them. She will act clueless as to the assassin and the meeting he was to go to. Human Perception roll vs. 20 to see that she might be lying. If asked why she is here, Mumashi will tell the party she comes here to relax and have a few drinks. She ask the party to join her. She will ask the party how's the investigation is going. If they keep their mouths shut good for them. She will start talking about the DMS offer and how Will really wanted to take it. &quot;This caused a considerable friction between the two. I couldn't really talk about it at the office in case Willie over heard. I like my job and don't want to lose it. I really don't know how far Willie was&nbsp; going to go to have Tom accept the offer.&quot; If questioned further she will play dumb but will drop some clues about the affair she is having with Will.<br/>
		                     When the party leaves RN they will be followed either on foot or vehicle. Awareness/Notice vs 15 to notice this tail. If the party tries to confront their shadowers they will be attacked by Lisa and her gang mates. They will attack the party until one of their members is killed or incapacitated.</div>

		                    He will be in his office whenever the party decides to confront him (even in the late hours. He feels guilty about what he's done and is moping in his office, along with getting drunk). When the party gets to Will's office they will find him a mess and drunk. When he see the party he will ask them how's it going. If they confront him that he might be the one who did it. He will break down and tell them that DMS offer was acceptable but he wasn't going to take when Tom didn't want it. Now that Tom is dead the truth came out. He then got an anonymous email saying that if he didn't sell PFA to Kikiishi Corporation they would reveal his affair with Mumashi and evidence to the police link Will to Tom's death. They also threatened to have his children killed. He doesn't suspect Mumashi because she seemed as surprised as he was. Will had no idea what to do so he hired the party.<br/>
		                    &nbsp;After revealing this the door to the office opens and Mumashi and 4-6 solos step in. Mumashi will say that it was her who had Tom killed and that the e-mail was from her. She will produce a contract that she demands Will to sign or else. This is the final encounter. If the party succeeds they will get double what Will offered them plus 100 shares in the company. There is also an AV-4 on top of the roof with a pilot and gunner waiting for the Arasaka team. That's if the players are on a killing spree.</div>
