        "<strong>10-01</strong> - Good news! After a long hiatus I have return to refereeing which I am excited about. It is take me a bit to get my creative muscles working again but the site will benefit.",
        "This month Cyberware gets some love. I have created another searchable cyberware list for you to reference. I have also implemented more functtionallity on the Character Generator for selecting and adding cyberware to your character. This leverages the master list data as well as the ability to make your own.",
        "Besides the cyberware section updates. I have also added some random rolls for name, role, and stats as well. The sheet is become more and more randomly generated.",
        "Since my creative juices are following I have added a new section in the Peeps section, Gangs. I have added a few new gangs that will be making appearances in my game.",
        "Another thing that I am adding to is the DLow section with some blueprints of some building, such as my vision of The Night Owl nightclub, NCART train, and the NC Med Center.",

        "<strong>09-01</strong> - A couple of things have been aded to the site.",
        "1st we have the master weapons list. This is a searchable list of the Cyberpunk 2020 weapons for all cannon sources for 2020 (no cybergeneration i'm afraid). This list will give you the base stats for the weapons, but won't go into the finer details about the weapon. For that you need to go to the source, which I list and the page in the source book you can find it on.",
        "Secondly I did an overhaul of the Cyberpunk 2020 weapons sections in the combat tracker and character generator. I made the sections consistent with each other. Also, I have added *drum roll* a ammo tracker on the weapons in both areas. This includes an ammo tracker in the PDF version of the character sheet as well. Though there might be some formatting issues in the PDF if the weapon list is long and/or the weapon has a lot of shots. Let me know if there is a bug and I will try to figure out a solution. ",
        "Other improvements included with the combat calculator. It is by no means perfect, there is still more tweaking and special rules need to be added, but I hope it is a tool closer to your needs. I can enable this same calculator on the Cyberpunk 2020 Character Generator as well. Let me know if you'd like to see that added.",
        "Cyberpunk Red Lifepath generator got some love this month as well. I switched out the text buttons to be icons (keeping consistent with the newer apps to the site), formatted the table to be red, and created a PDF button to generate the lifepath in a one page PDF (with the style of red).",
        "Again, if there are any bugs or ideas for enhancements let me know and I will try to get them resolved.",

        "<strong>08-09</strong> - Did some bug fixes on the Combat Tracker thanks to Pawook over on the Cyberpunk 2020/RED Fans discord. The fixes are with the weapn, skill, cyber, and gear tabs when adding new items they get sticky. Added the BOD damage modifier to melee weapon damage rolls. Fixed the WA not being shown in the to-hit roll. Change the text for dice rolls and fixed an issue with the + modifier to damage dice.",
        "<strong>08-01</strong> - I change the menu a bit to turn it into a megamenu, which should space it out a bit more to help with using the menu on longer list of choices.",
        "A new app has been added: Cyberpunk 2020 Netrunner Deck Manager utility. This app allows you to create/enter a cyberdeck and programs for it. It keeps track of the costs as well as how many programs you have loaded into the deck.",
        "There are also some bug fixes with the combat tracker. Sorry about those, I should have caught them through testing. But the tracker shoudl be working better now. I have some addtional ideas for the tracker to help with doing combat, like choosing rounds to fire (including full auto/3rd burst). As well as a few other items.",

        "The covert roles from <a href='https://talsorianstore.com/products/firestorm-stormfront'>Firestrom: Stormfront</a> have been added to the role list and the character generator as well. There is still some work needed for the min skill values that the roles have. In time they will come.",

I'm sure there are more and some entries I've missed. I also changed some of the Roles and skills to fit in line with others to keep them standardized.",
        "The update to the character genarator/sheet was to include all the roles from the master list and added a couple of skills. I didn't add all the skills, due to formatting issues, but roles that have skills not listed will add them to the Others section of skills.",
