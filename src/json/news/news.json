        "<strong>12-01</strong> - Not much this month other than some bug fixes. I have the full system of Red now and will be looking to add some more apps in the next few months. There will be some limitations though as I have talked with RTG. The utilities I create will not have any published data in them, as per reqeust from RTG. This means they will be very generic and require a bit of data entry on the part of you. I will make sure to have the ability to save your work.",

        "<strong>11-01</strong> - This update includes a fan request. The Scout1255 over on reddit had a request for a Combat Zone Generator. They asked and sounded like a great idea. The Combat Zone Generator will create a map of 3x4 blocks and list a description for each bulding with a key to use. It will also have a section to generator objects that will be on the street. This is nothing too fancy, but should help out with creating a neighborhood quickly for your game. You can export to PDF, but some of the building outlines don't render well.",
        "Other things that I did was fixing some minor bugs and some behind the scenes logistics. Still waiting on my copy of the Red so I can pump out some utilities for the game.Cyberpunk 2077 is coming out this month too. I hope I will have time to get some more work done on the site, but I have a feeling my schedule might be sucked up with all that game play.",

        "<strong>10-07</strong> - Did some bug fixes. One enhancement is the stats section on the CP2020 Character Generator and Combat Tracker. Now you have the ability to add different modifiers to the stat. I also added an Initiative field to the character generation. You can manage any initiative modifiers to it as well. The other thing you will notice is that the stats and wound sections are now the same in both the combat tracker and character generator.",
        "<strong>10-01</strong> - Good news! After a long hiatus I have return to refereeing Cyberpunk 2020 which I am excited about. It has been taking me a bit to get my creative muscles working again but the site will benefit.",
        "This month Cyberware gets some love. I have created another searchable master list for cyberware for your reference. Again, like most of the master lists, it goes off of canon material I own. Which isn't to shabby of a collection. I have also implemented this list and more functionallity on the Character Generator for adding cyberware to your character.",
        "Besides the cyberware updates. I have also added some random rolls for name, role, and stats to the CP2020 Character Generator. The sheet has more and more randomly generation. The PDF export on the sheet has some tweaks as well with the weapon note formatting and the cyberware name.",
        "Since my creative juices are flowing I have added a new item in the Peeps section, Gangs/Nomad Packs. I added a few new gangs that will be making appearances in my game as well as a nomad pack. I also added some more NPCs as well.",
        "Last thing added is to the DLow section. I created some blueprints of my vision of The Night Owl nightclub, NCART train, and the NCART stations.",
        "Cyberpunk Red I hope is just around the corner. When it hits the street, I hope to add in more utilities for it to the site. First app I will be adding is a converter for CP2020 to CPRed. There are a few other apps I have ideas for, but until I have the full ruleset I really don't want to start working on the code.",

        "<strong>09-01</strong> - A couple of things have been aded to the site.",
        "1st we have the master weapons list. This is a searchable list of the Cyberpunk 2020 weapons for all cannon sources for 2020 (no cybergeneration i'm afraid). This list will give you the base stats for the weapons, but won't go into the finer details about the weapon. For that you need to go to the source, which I list and the page in the source book you can find it on.",
        "Secondly I did an overhaul of the Cyberpunk 2020 weapons sections in the combat tracker and character generator. I made the sections consistent with each other. Also, I have added *drum roll* a ammo tracker on the weapons in both areas. This includes an ammo tracker in the PDF version of the character sheet as well. Though there might be some formatting issues in the PDF if the weapon list is long and/or the weapon has a lot of shots. Let me know if there is a bug and I will try to figure out a solution. ",
        "Other improvements included with the combat calculator. It is by no means perfect, there is still more tweaking and special rules need to be added, but I hope it is a tool closer to your needs. I can enable this same calculator on the Cyberpunk 2020 Character Generator as well. Let me know if you'd like to see that added.",
        "Cyberpunk Red Lifepath generator got some love this month as well. I switched out the text buttons to be icons (keeping consistent with the newer apps to the site), formatted the table to be red, and created a PDF button to generate the lifepath in a one page PDF (with the style of red).",
        "Again, if there are any bugs or ideas for enhancements let me know and I will try to get them resolved.",

        "<strong>08-09</strong> - Did some bug fixes on the Combat Tracker thanks to Pawook over on the Cyberpunk 2020/RED Fans discord. The fixes are with the weapn, skill, cyber, and gear tabs when adding new items they get sticky. Added the BOD damage modifier to melee weapon damage rolls. Fixed the WA not being shown in the to-hit roll. Change the text for dice rolls and fixed an issue with the + modifier to damage dice.",
        "<strong>08-01</strong> - I change the menu a bit to turn it into a megamenu, which should space it out a bit more to help with using the menu on longer list of choices.",
        "A new app has been added: Cyberpunk 2020 Netrunner Deck Manager utility. This app allows you to create/enter a cyberdeck and programs for it. It keeps track of the costs as well as how many programs you have loaded into the deck.",
        "There are also some bug fixes with the combat tracker. Sorry about those, I should have caught them through testing. But the tracker shoudl be working better now. I have some addtional ideas for the tracker to help with doing combat, like choosing rounds to fire (including full auto/3rd burst). As well as a few other items.",
