There will be some limitations though as I have talked with RTG. The utilities I create will not have any published data in them, as per reqeust from RTG. This means they will be very generic and require a bit of data entry on the part of you. I will make sure to have the ability to save your work.",

        "<strong>11-01</strong> - This update includes a fan request. The Scout1255 over on reddit had a request for a Combat Zone Generator. They asked and sounded like a great idea. The Combat Zone Generator will create a map of 3x4 blocks and list a description for each bulding with a key to use. It will also have a section to generator objects that will be on the street. This is nothing too fancy, but should help out with creating a neighborhood quickly for your game. You can export to PDF, but some of the building outlines don't render well.",
        "Other things that I did was fixing some minor bugs and some behind the scenes logistics. Still waiting on my copy of the Red so I can pump out some utilities for the game.Cyberpunk 2077 is coming out this month too. I hope I will have time to get some more work done on the site, but I have a feeling my schedule might be sucked up with all that game play.",

Now you have the ability to add different modifiers to the stat. I also added an Initiative field to the character generation. You can manage any initiative modifiers to it as well. The other thing you will notice is that the stats and wound sections are now the same in both the combat tracker and character generator.",

        "This month Cyberware gets some love. I have created another searchable master list for cyberware for your reference. Again, like most of the master lists, it goes off of canon material I own. Which isn't to shabby of a collection. I have also implemented this list and more functionallity on the Character Generator for adding cyberware to your character.",
        "Besides the cyberware updates. I have also added some random rolls for name, role, and stats to the CP2020 Character Generator. The sheet has more and more randomly generation. The PDF export on the sheet has some tweaks as well with the weapon note formatting and the cyberware name.",
        "Since my creative juices are flowing I have added a new item in the Peeps section, Gangs/Nomad Packs. I added a few new gangs that will be making appearances in my game as well as a nomad pack. I also added some more NPCs as well.",
        "Last thing added is to the DLow section. I created some blueprints of my vision of The Night Owl nightclub, NCART train, and the NCART stations.",
        "Cyberpunk Red I hope is just around the corner. When it hits the street, I hope to add in more utilities for it to the site. First app I will be adding is a converter for CP2020 to CPRed. There are a few other apps I have ideas for, but until I have the full ruleset I really don't want to start working on the code.",

        "1st we have the master weapons list. This is a searchable list of the Cyberpunk 2020 weapons for all cannon sources for 2020 (no cybergeneration i'm afraid). This list will give you the base stats for the weapons, but won't go into the finer details about the weapon. For that you need to go to the source, which I list and the page in the source book you can find it on.",
        "Secondly I did an overhaul of the Cyberpunk 2020 weapons sections in the combat tracker and character generator. I made the sections consistent with each other. Also, I have added *drum roll* a ammo tracker on the weapons in both areas. This includes an ammo tracker in the PDF version of the character sheet as well. Though there might be some formatting issues in the PDF if the weapon list is long and/or the weapon has a lot of shots. Let me know if there is a bug and I will try to figure out a solution. ",
        "Other improvements included with the combat calculator. It is by no means perfect, there is still more tweaking and special rules need to be added, but I hope it is a tool closer to your needs. I can enable this same calculator on the Cyberpunk 2020 Character Generator as well. Let me know if you'd like to see that added.",
        "Cyberpunk Red Lifepath generator got some love this month as well. I switched out the text buttons to be icons (keeping consistent with the newer apps to the site), formatted the table to be red, and created a PDF button to generate the lifepath in a one page PDF (with the style of red).",

When I hear the news, those CP sleeper cells started reacting. IT has been a while, yes, over 12 years since I posted things. It has been that long since I've played CP 2020 as well. Though I don't have a group as of yet, I still love the game. I want to do some updates for those of you who love and adore the blood and chrome. Who knows? One of those who come to this site and lives in CT USA might email me to start a group up. I plan on doing some changes to the site, small incremental ones. So don't expect too much. I mainly will be editing this site as my knowlege of web site development has increased since last I updated. I have a few things in the pipeline, one being conversion of Night City maps into a <a href='http://www.profantasy.com/products/cc3.asp' target='_blank'>Campaign Cartographer 3</a> map. IF you haven't seen this tool, it is very nice program for creating maps for RPGs.",

              "I'm back again, and this time it's personal! Only kidding, but as you can tell I've done some reconstruction on the site. For starters the looks and navigation of the site is different. I moved the contract section and placed it in the <b>Library</b>. It's a better place for it anyways. I removed some old links from the <b>LDL</b> and add a few more. New equipment has been added to the <b>Shop</b>. I created something in every category. Thought it was time to stop teasing all of ya. Part 2 of the <b>Prometheus Chronicle</b> is up. Do you want more? As I said, I haven't played CP in AWHILE and it proably will stay that way for sometime. DnD and WHFRP are the two games right now that have my attention. Hopefully when the new version comes out, I be more into it. : ("

These are based off of the longest Cyberpunk campaign I've ever had. I also added a new netrunning system in the <b>Law</b> section. Hopefully it will speed things up for your games with that netrunner. And finally I have made my own Character sheet, it's in <b>Library</b>. I use the hunmanity lose from Grimm's Cybertales. An awesome book. A must for the serious Referee. It might be another few months before I post again. Haven't played Cyberpunk in AWHILE so I'm not into creating until I get my juices flowing again." ]

Well sitting at work I came up with some and thought it would be a good idea to update my site for all of my wonderful readers. Let's start with the <b>Proteus Project</b>, yes I added a couple more program descriptions to Anti-System and Anti-Personal ICE. Also in the <b>Law</b> section, I added some rules on stats and careers. Computer nerds shouldn't have a 10 bod if they sit on their @$$es all day right? Also a pre-life path for when characters grew up. If you're parents were corp execs, then you should have some Gen Know skill for the schools they sent you to. Well three things done in 4 months, average about one new thing a month isn't bad I suppose. Til next time." ]
