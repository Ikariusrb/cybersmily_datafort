  "playerinfo":"<strong>For &quot;NCPD Blues&quot; scenario</strong><h6>Tom Yokonu a.k.a Shade</h6><br>Cool and quiet that's me. This better be an important op. Why are we working with the cops? I could take care of the whole thing with a select  black-ops team. Arasaka better know what their doing, because I'm not going down alone if this op goes sour. I've trained too hard and too long for a high profile, simple job like this to go wrong. I hope Arasaka doesnt plan on retiring me. This job could be the start of my downward spiral. I know there are other jobs out there, ones that will appreciate my skills and quality. I think I might need to contact the Vulture, the fixer I know. Especially if Arasaka is planning on getting rid of me.<br><br><strong>Lips</strong> - Seems like a decent police officer. Maybe trouble if we need to do anything illegal. Hopefully Mum can buy him off.<br><strong>Lady J</strong> - I think she's on the take. I don't know why I think it but something about her. Definitely watch her.<br><strong>Tin</strong> - Borg wannabe. He'll be the first to die if the crap hits the helo. Whether it be by Diamond or me.<br><strong>Mum</strong> - She's nervous about something. No doubt Arasaka is putting a hell of a lot of pressure on her to succeed. Hope I don't have to delete her, she's kinda cute.<br><strong>Egg</strong> - Looks to be O.K. Too much of a toady tough."
