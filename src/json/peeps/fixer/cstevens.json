	"history":"Cory grew up in the combat zone and learned life's lessons the hard way. That made her more self-reliant and determine to do better. One night she was hanging out at a bar and saw this band Dy 'n Lyte. They were pretty good and she offered them her services as a manager. They accepted and Cory's career began. The band was formed by Dy, her brother Lyte, her boyfriend BD, and Lyte's friend Splice. Things were going good, but Cory feared that something might happen with a zealous fan. Cory hired a guy named Stacks to be the band's bodyguard. Now things were going better and Cory has been scoring bigger gigs for the band. Life in a rock band is good."
