  "history" : "BMS was formed back at the turn of the century. Jeff Terlin was CEO of a large pharmaceutical corporation. During the chaos of the collapse he saw an opportunity to take control of other medical and pharmaceutical companies in the area. He quickly merge with several in attempt for those companies to survive. The other companies thought it was in their best interest to band together, but they soon realized that Terlin was in it for control. Through underlings Terlin was able to acquire controlling interest in all the companies. Now in 2020 BMS has started a more aggressive business plan. This has caused Biotechnica and Petrochem to take notice.<br/>A few years back the main AI for BMS headquarters, named Prometheus, went rogue. A elite team of BMS Black Ops, named Team Alpha, broke into the facility and stole the core programming of Prometheus. Apparently Prometheus hired the team away from BMS and was able to help with their controling implants that BMS had installed on the Operatives. BMS has sent a team after Prometheus only to have them killed. Netwatch has been informed and Prometheus is now on the top ten most wanted Rogue AIs.",
