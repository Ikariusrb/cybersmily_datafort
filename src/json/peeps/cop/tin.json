This chipped away at his humanity. When he returned to civilian life, and took a gig with the NCPD, C-SWAT division. There his combat skills shined, though the higher-ups fear he will eventually be the hunted. He works closely with Lady J, another C-SWAT officer. Though they don't hang out after work, they do work well together.", "playerinfo":"<strong>For &quot;NCPD Blues&quot; scenario</strong><h6>Officer Jeremy &quot;Tin&quot; Tomum, C-SWAT NCPD</h6><br>I like guns.
