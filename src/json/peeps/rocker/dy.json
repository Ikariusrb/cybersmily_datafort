Both of them hit it off right away. Di thinks BD is one of the greatest guys she knows, next to her brother. When her brother, Lyte, got back from the war, both of them decided to form a band with your current boyfriend, BD, and Lyte's friend Splice. The band was doing good with the help from the band's manager Cory Stevens. Cory also got some protection in the way of a bodyguard named Stacks.
