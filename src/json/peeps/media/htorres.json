	"history":"Harden Torres does the street report on channel WNS-7, Night City News force Team. Harden is a vet for the SoAm wars and is very gruff. His opinions on air and off have often gotten him in trouble, but WNS keeps him to give the appearance of being unbiased. Harden knows he's being used in this way and takes advantage of it. Currently he is mentoring Mac V and knows that WNS will replace him with the kid. Harden hopes to instill a backbone in Mac to become a true, dedicated journalist and not a corporate tool."
