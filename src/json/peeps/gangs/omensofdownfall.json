They recruit mostly from the deliquents and runaways teenagers from Rancho Coronado, Westbrook and North Oak. The Omens traffick in drugs, robbery, and extortion racket. Often propositioned by the ignorant for prositution, the unaware jown will learn they aren't going to be providing any service other than violence and robbery. Most victims will survive the beating but some end up in pieces at a body shop.",
