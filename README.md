# cybersmily_datafort
This is the code base for the cybersmily.net fansite for Cyberpunk 2020/Red. This is an Angular SPA site.

The site has several sections to choose from 

# Data
Data I have collected. Lists of things (gear, programs, vehicles, stuff) that I have compiled. Most of the content is conversions of other sources to fit with CP 2020 rule set.

# Mods
Modifications to the rules. This section contains rule mods and house rules I have used in some of my games over the years. Some are good, some not so much. But figure I'd share as a few of them might fit with your style of play.

# Shop
Shop for custom gear I have created or re-engineered from other sources.

# Peeps
The peeps that are in my campaign. NPCs and PCs from my games. Some of them are used within the scenarios on this site.

# Gigs
Gigs for your edgerunners. Some scenarios I have run at conventions and with my group. You can also find here a news cast following the Firestorm supplement from R. Talsorian.

# Apps
Applications (online utilities) for your game. Includes a lifepath generator, fashion calculator, Max Metal Calculator, and a Netrunning utility app for navigating the net.

# DLow
Downloads for use with your game. There's a PC Sheet, image files of maps, and Campaign Cartographer vector maps of Night City.

# LDLs
Long Distance Links of other dataforts I visit, and. some of the websites I believe are required for use with running and playing CP 2020.
